Madison, the'Father of the Constitution,' wasagainst ''innovation' and Hamil-'ton' feared the turbulent, chan-'ging people. So the Constitution'was made unchangeable except b.a vote of two-thirds of Congress,and three-fourths of the StateLegislatures or State Conventions.One-forty-fourth df the voters to- jday, if prperly placoed, can block'any amendment. Of the four,hundred and thirty-five amend-'wents proposed from 1889 to 1904'noi one was aaopteu. it is tnebelief of many people that the;Constitution can never be amend-'ed. I"We, on 'the other hand, believeAmendment permiting the income1tax, is possible, probable, inevita-'cle. The- resolution was. -unani-jmously adopted by the Senate,and. almost unanimously by theHouse. Thirty-five of the fortysix States must ratify, but thirty-fiveStates will be found. TheSouth is for it; the west is forit; the real people of the Eastare for it; the two parties havedeclared in. its favor and President Taft has taken his stand onit. It is more than the merequestion of an income tax, although that is important. It is aquestion of national sovereignty,of the right of ninety millions ofpetTple to tax. themselves as theydeem just and expedient. It isan issue upon which in times ofdanger the national welfare, even the national existence, mightdepend. The Sixteenth Amendment nnist and will be adopted.But it will not be adopted bythe people staying at. home andwishing for it. It must be madean issue in every 'State, in everyassembly district. Time fightson the side of the SixteenthAmendment; there is no limit.Once a State adopts it, the ratification lasts' forever. But ifthe ratification is not made thefirst session, H may be again pro-,posed for 'the second, third,tenth, or ninety-ninth time. If iwedo not suceed at first,, we canj try, try again.I The Sixteenth Amendmentmust be ratfiied, not only to enable pur Government in times ofpeace and war to impose equita-.ble taxes, but also to place thefundamental law of the land,where it should be placed in thehands of an intelligent, tolerant,and liberty-loving, people.I Death of W.

The good run of 64.000 cattle here last week, including 12,000 calves, was fairly welldisposed of, although the hold over at the end of the week was 2,heavier than the numberremaining in the yards at the endof the previous week. The beststeers held steady during theweek, account of scarcity, topsteers for the week at $8.15, butmedium grade steers declined 25to 50 cents, andd the cheapestbef steers lost 5 to 15 cents. Themedium class suffered most because of a big run of rangersfrom Montana and Dakota is nowappearing at the Northern markets, a class of cattle similar inkilling qualities to the steers thatsell on our market at $4.50 to $6.25, and buyers were accordinglyable to dictate terms to a certainextent. The good demand herefor stockers and feeders offsetthis effect, somewhat. Cows advanced 10 to 15 cents and canners sold 15 to 25 higher by theclose of last week, stockers andfeeders steady. The run todayis 30.000 head, market steady toa shade lower. Channels for themovement of all classes of cattleare always wide open on Mondajand practically .nothing is quoted more than 10. lower today.The feature' today' is the. strongdemand for grass cows, especially eanners. No extra good fedsteers are here today, althoughsome yearlings made $7.75, thetop for the day. Not as manygood grass steers are coining asA weeks ago, best at $5.75 to $b'.-50, medium and light steersto $5.50, cows $2.75 to $4.25, heifers up to $5.50, bulls $2.50 to $3.-75, calves $3.75 to $(.50, stockers $3.25 to $4.75, feeders $4.00to $5.75 In 'spite of recent dde-clincs in beef cattle, present prices are 50 to 75 cents above thisperiod a year ago.The I102 market continues to liean tnijjnuT. to dealers, as nobodyseems able to make any reliableforecast, either as to price prospects or future supply, l'aekerpaver that thev are losing nmnoyon every hog they buy. but theirefforts to price are without effectThe run last week was largestsince June, at 52.000 head, butthe market closed at about thebest point of the wecki Kun today is !00 head, market weak to10 lower, top $8.35, bulk of sales$7.85 to $8.25.

A littlelater a neatly dressed negro with whiteapron called at the hotel for the sack,representing himself as a porter, andstating that he had been sent for thesack. The money contained in the sackamounted to $424.A few minutes after this negro haddisappeared, a representative of thedrug company called for the sack andwhen told that it had been delivered.there was almost a collapse, and all' wasexcitement. The police being notified,set the whole machinery of the law inmotion, with detectives and officers onthe alert.Later in the day Detective Price arrested a suspect, a negro who had beenin the drug company's employ, but liewas sweated in vain. During the dayeight negroes were arrested on suspicion, but when confronted by the hotelclerk were released.The theft of the money is still mysterious. While some negroes are sispected and are being held in surveillance, the trick should he credited tosonic white man, who must have hadknowledge of the money being in thesack being taken to the hotel for safek:eping until Monday morning.DR. HAMILTON JONESWat Are the Health Laws BetweenPoliticiansThe article following is an editorialof the Picayune, clipped from its Suniday's issue. The Picayune is alwaysconservative, as well as prudent in theexpression of its views, and thereforeits utterance in this case is no less significant:"The resignation of Dr. HamiltonJones, pure food commissioner of theState Board of Health, was announcedyesterday. So far as information on thesubject goes it grew out of the strict enforcement of the law in regard to ashipment of yosters received in this cityin a condition condemned by the law itself in such cases, and it entailed somepecuniary loss.'But it appears some political antagonism was aroused and the law was unhappily in the way of settling all disagreement, and so the enforcer of thelaw had to go, or at least felt so."This was something like an incidentwhich occurred when Grover Clevelandwas Governor of New York. The Hon.Tim Campbell, a prominent Democraticpolitician, was a great admirer of thegovernor's solid integrity and regard forlaw, but on one occasion he was earnestly in favor of some proposed measure which Cleveland believed to be contrary to the Constitution, and the Hon.Tim went to the governor to urge hisconse t."But Governor Cleveland kindly butfirmly told the statesmen that consentwas impossible, because the propositionwas unconstitutional. "Oh," said Mr.Campbell, "that would be all right ifother politicians wanted it done, but,my dear governor, what is the Constitution between friends?'"That is it precisely. What is a healthlaw between politicians? But Clevelhnd,whether Governor of New York orPresident of the United States, wouldnot surrender the claims of the Constitution even to a friend. As the physical constitution and by-laws of humanhealth are quite as urgent, they shouldnot be sacrificed on any account."EXPLANATION BY DR. DOWLING.As to the resignation of Dr. Jones, ina letter to Mr. Tatman Thompson, thechairman of the Merchants Club, andMr. George P. Thompson, president ofthe Wholesale Grocers Association, ofNew Orleans, Dr. Dowling says:"I beg to assure you politics playedabsolutely no part in the matter and action by the board was in the interest ofthe taxpayers of the State. Dr. Jonesis a man of ability ard attainments andit is with regret that the board recognizes his lack of sympathy with its policy and methods."And for once there is no politics in itand the world moves.RUBBER STAMPS.I ap -prepared to furnish rubberstam9i o short notice, duplicating oldgate -d alig stamps to order.,iWOMAN CONVICTEDNlr,.

During the year the cotton acreagewill le increased because it is believedh y the farmers that they have learnedenough of the lesson of cotton culture,under new conditions, to raise the staplecrop in spite of the weevil.It usually takes a section about threeyI ars to get over the advent of the bollwet vil, atd to learn how to raise cottonin spite of the activities o' the pest.This section has had the weevil threjyears and this year being the fourth,hopes to be able to increase very materially its cotton production.In some of the boll weevil parishes ofNorth Louisiana, where the weevil firstmade its appearance, and the lesson ofthe new method was thoroughly learned,as good crops were raised last year asever before the pest made its appearance.The adoption of the recent constitutional amendment setting aside fourmills for the Confederate pension fundwill give the Confederate veterans forthis spring $25oooo for the Confederatepension fund, the largest amount thatthe veterans have ever had at their disposal since the organioitior of the StatePension Board.As this money will be available at thenext meeting of the State PensionBoard, the session of the board will be along one, as the long list ofapplicantsfor pensions which have not been passedupon because the board did not have themoney with which to pay the pensionshould the applicatiott be allowed, willhave to be gone over, and if worthy, thename put on the pension roll.REAL ESTATE TRANSFERS.As furnished by the Caddo AbstractCompany, office 517 Marshall' street, thefollowing real estate transfers were recorded during the day:Leonard Wortman et al to A.

R. U. Pleasant, .A siktant ttoýrueyGeneral, in the Case.Col. R. G. Pleasant, a; istant Attarney General, who numbers his friendsin Shreveport by the score, appeared inthe District Court, Julge F W. Stitherlin, Monday anl argued ti catse ofthe State against the Caddo (as and OilCompany.The suit was filed by HIon. Leon R.Smith in behalf of the State to force theclosing of a wild gas well in the gasfield of Caddo parish, from which millions of feet of gas have been wasted.The argument of Colonel Pleasant andof Dlr. Smith on the necessity of closing the wildl well and in conserving gasfor the people was clear and logical.The defendant company was ably represented by Ilon. John D. Wilkinson,whose argument was on the plea to anexception of no cause for action.It will now devolve on the court todetermine if there is a cause for action.If there is, then the case will take theusual course and probably may go to theSupreme Court, with years interveningbefore a final decision is reached.THE SIXTEENTH AMENDMENTIN THE LOUISIANALEGISLATURE.(To the Caucasian)As shown by the House Journal of1910 the Sixteenth Amendment to theConstitution of the United States wasendorsed by the popular branch of theGeneral Assembly as followsMr. Johnson of Washington introduced House Concurrent ResolutionNo. t, ratifying the Sixteenth Amendmient to the Constitution of the UnitedStates, which was referred to the cornnittee on Federal relations. After dueconsideration this comlnittee reportedas follows:"House of Representatives, State ofLoutiiana, Baton Rouge, La., May 20,19to.-To the Honorable the Speakerand Members of the House of Representatives of the State of LouisianaGentlemen I ant directed by your committee on Federal relations to submitthe following report House ConcurrentResolution No. i, by Mr. Johnson (ofWashington) ratifying the SixteenthAmendment to the Constitution of theUnited States (here printing the resolution). Favorably."W. E.

The question thenrecurred on the motion to adopt 'theresolution to ratify the amendment. Theroll being called resulted as follows:Yeas 78; nays 3t; absent 7.Thus it is seen that the House votedoverwhelmingly in favor of the IncomeTax Amendment.But in the Senate-As shown by theSenate Journal the Sixteenth or IncomeTax Amendment was overwhelminglydefeated.On June 7 the House Concurrent Resolution by Mr. Johnson was so amendedas to refer the said Sixteenth Amendment to a general State primary election for ratification or rejection by thequalified electors, said vote to be bindingon the next General Assembly. The voteon this amendment was yeas 26, naysii, absent 4.As amended the Johnson resolutionwas concurred in by the Senate by thefollowing vote: Yeas 28, nays 9, absent 4.The Johnson Concurrent Resolutionhaving thus been materially amended bythe Senate was sent back to the Housefor concurrence in the Senate amendment. The House refused to concur,and the amended resolution was sent toconference, both houses appointing conferrees. There the Johnson resolutionrests, and the Sixteenth Amendmentfailed of ratification in so-called Democratic Louisiana. On the South reststhe responsibility.

Ruleshave been adopted sufficient for thelegal transaction of legislative business and as soon as the decks arecleared for action this morning aconcurrent resolution will be introduced in both houses., submitting tothe people an amendment to the constitution providing for the recall ofjudges, and it will be passed quickerthan either President Taft or theproletariat can say Jack Robinson..Colore the smoke clears away a jointresolution will drift in. to the effectthat Arizona endorses the proposedsixteenth amendment to the constitution of the United States, providingfor an income tax. Thirty-one stateshave already endorsed it and only fivemore are needed. There will be oneless today and the time has arrivedfor the plutocrats to throw up theirhands, or at least stand up and becounted.Anyhow, that was the frame-up lastnight.TlHJt the legislature would do thisvery thing very early in the sessionhas been expected, but it was left forthe genius of Homer 'Wood, councilman from Yavapai to inject the spectucular coloring into the project. Thatis the. reason no more was done yesterday. It had been planned to donothing else until these matters hadbeen worked out of the legislativesystem. The houses were organizedami everything put in readiness, butwith a clean slate until the soda pop,root beer or whatever the medicinewas. should get the gentlemen in condition for the effort, and now theyare ready.It would seem to the ordinary person that this state of preparednessought not to be hard to attain butthe ordinary person has little knowledge of just how thoroughly the workwas to be done. The democraticbrethren went before the peoplepledged to put back the recall provision eliminated last December, precisely in the same form it appearedin the original constitution and theypropose to redeem that pledge or busttheir galluses. Homer Wood took thetrouble to secure from the archivesthe identical official copy or the original constitution, and swearing inblood that he would return the sacreddocument to its proper custodian hesought the lair of a photographer,where he had the recall section reproduced with every pen-scratch,smear and fly speck, together withthe yellow spots made by the tears inwhich it was bathed when It wasfound the section was for the timebeing to be ineffective.One of these photographic reproductions will form the body of theresolution that Is to be introduced ineach house this morning as soon asthe prayers of the chaplains ceasetheir echoing iind Mr. Wood can gainrecognition of President Cunniff andJudge Wren or Yavapai can detectthe nod or Speaker Bradner.After this deed has been done C. B.Wood will seize the earliest oppor- jtunity in the senate and Don Babbitt;in the house, to present Arizona's jformal ratification of the sixteenthamendment to the constitution of the!United States. These gentlemen didnot have time to senu for the originalcopy in Washington to incorporate apicture in their resolution, but willhave to express their sentiments inthe artistic hand of an official typist.Yesterday's WorkIt would be a mean and fault-findingperson who would take exceptionto anything the 'Arizona legislaturedid yesterday. More than that, hewould be a genius for the sum totalof important action consisted in theadoption by both houses of the rulesof the twenty-fifth legislative assembly, temporarily, until the respectivehouses can formulate new rules, better to their liking.Instead of being critical one shouldbe complimentary if It were necessary for any comment, for the gentlemen displayed greater promptnessthan at any time heretofore. Thesenate began business promptly at 1o'clock, the advertised hour, and thehouse was only five minutes late.The senate opened in due form withroll call, prayer and the reading ofthe minutes, took the action referredto and adjourned to meet again todayat the same hour.The house did a little better, for inEMBARGO HASCLOSED DOWNCOPPER MINESHundreds of Mexicans HaveBeen Thrown Out ofWork by President's ActionORDER STARTS ARIOT IN JUAREZArmy Officer Says the Conditions in Mexico AreNot as Bad asReportedAssociated Press DispatchHL PASO.

March 20. All minesin the bituminous fields of Ohio. Indiana, Pennsylvania and Illinois willclose down April 1. and 200.000 menbe thrown out of work, according tothe operators and miners who conrerred here today. It will not be astrike. It is announced, but merelya suspension pending negotiations Tora working scale for the next twoyears to succeed the present scale,which expires March "1. PresidentWhite, of the miners, said the unionmen had come to meet the operatorson friendly terms, but intended to adhere to their demands. These areten cents increase a ton, mining of allcoal on a tonnage basis, and pay dayevery week instead of twice monthly.The operators claim the demands areequal to a 20 per cent increase andthey are not able to grant them. Itis agreed by both sides a strike Isnot wanted, but owing to the latenessof negotiations, it is certain work willhave to suspend at least two weeks,as thu miners must refer any agreement reached to a referendum.It was said tonight that lack of awage scale in the central states wouldleave the question for bituminousminers in other states without abasis within which to work, andwould entail idleness on more thanthree hundred and fifty thousandminers. After today's conference adjourned till tomorrow, union officialsand operators announced only infirm of the miners' demands hadbeen considered and no vote taken.This demand is that all men be paidon a "mine run" basis. Present payis based either on a ton of screenedcoal."Run of mine" basis is already inuse in some states and would provide a flat rate per ton for all coalmined. In the readjustment on thisbasis the miners demand an incrcasv-of ten cents a ton over the averageprice now paid. They also wantshorter working hours. As an olfsetto these demands the operators wanta reduction from the present rate.The number of men in the mines involved are: Western Pennsylvania.sK-tv thousand miners, two hundredand fifty mines; Onio, forty-seventhousand miners, four hundrey and fifty mines: Indiana twenty-two thousandminers, one hundred and forty-sevenmines: Illinois, .seventy-two thousandminers, three hundred and twentymines. The number of miners inother states who, it is said, necessarily will have to suspend work because of the lack of a fixed basisfor agreements, which also will expire April 1. are: Oklahoma, Missouri, Arkansas and Kansas, comprising the southwestern district,thirty thousand miners; Iowa, fifteenthousand: Michigan. ten thousand.Operators assert the suspension ofthe mines which employ union menwill leave work In Kentucky, Alabama, West Virginia, Central Pennsylvania, and Tennessee, where aboutthree hundred thousand miners arenot enrolled i" the union,SENA RELATESWHOLE SORDIDEAlleged Sale of Legislative"Votes is Told inDetail to theCommitteeACCUSED DENYTHEIR GUILTDefense Claims the MenWere Trapped and AreInnocent of AllWrongdoingAssociated Press DispatchSANTA FE.

Speaker Bradner will likely announce the committee assignments;and therein there is a strong probability that he will show his undyinglove for the Lynch supporters. Thereare twenty-five house committees andonly sixteen real, sure-enough, blownin the bottle Bradner men. "When thoBradnerites are taken care of withchairmanships, there will be nine remaining. Just what is to be done withthese Is likely causing Mr. Bradnerand Governor Hunt, with reference towhose wishes all moves in the houseare made, considerable perplexity.It is persistently denied by thethick-and-thin supporters of the administration that there was such athing as the application of the steamroller in the election of Uradncr andthe organization of the house. Butevery sensible man in fact everyman who knows enough to keep hiseyes and ears open knows that therewas one of the prettiest exhibitions orthe steam roller in politics ever witnessed in a pre-leglslative fight. Bythreats and cajolery, by promises ofthe bestowal of patronage here andthreats of its withdrawal there theelection of Bradner was forced by theadministration Anybody who doubtwthe existence of the steam rollershould watch the committee appointments tomorrow and he may Icarn afew edifying facts.Rumors were flying about the capitol yesterday that Hunt has backeddown in his economy program completely. The long list of house attaches will be preserved Intact. Andthe reason is a very simple one. Sir.Hunt Is not in position to say a greatdeal on the subject of employes. Atthe present writing his excellency hasfive employes in his own office,whereas Governor Sloan managed toget along and do all necessary workwitli two. And that doesn't tell thewhole story. Hunt not only has fivepersons attached to the governor's office, but some of them will be paidfor overtime, it Is said. In point ofexpense, then, the governor's office,so far as the attaches are concerned,is said to be costing the state aboutthree and a half times what it costunder Governor Sloan's administration.There is some actual economy manifest in the senate: but this is morothan overbalanced by the house andthe executive office, where employesare as plentirul as mosquitoes in thevicinity of a Jersey swamp.It's all quite funny. To be sure itwill go rather hard with the pocketbooks of the taxpayers: but whenthese same taxpayers once wake upto the political gold brick that hasbeen handed them there Is a strongprobability that there will be some"doings" in Arizona that will make allthe state's past experiences look astame as a kid's game of mumblctypeg. oWAS A MISTAKE.President Reassured Regarding Reportof Accident to His Wife.Associated Press DispatchWASHINGTON.

The western senators propose to use the Connecticutriver bill as a method of securing desired changes in the conservation laws,which will permit freer use of weBternwater power resources.While the bill now before the senate received the endorsement of thesenate commerce on commerce a majority of that committee headed bySenators Bankhead and Nelson, havesince signed a report protestingagainst the principle of giving thegovernment control over water powers.Their opposition centers on the argument of "states' rights," and the contention that the federal government"has no moral' or legal ground to demand compensation in any form."President Taft's administration, andSecretary of War Stimson are behindthe idea of federal control as nowembodied in the bill.To Pass Billion Mark DespiteThe Promises By Democrat LeadersCONGRESS APPROPRIATIONS PILE VP WITH LITTLE REGARD FORWashington, D. C.. Feb. 3.—Democratic leaders in congress are apprehensive that their old slogan of economy in government expenditures willhe silenced unless something drastic isdone at once in the way of stoppingthe "raids" upon the treasury. Theyfear that the present extravagant tendency will result in giving this congress a record in the matter of hugeappropriations, which will exceed thatset by the republicans a few years ago.During the last campaign democraticorators upon the stump promised thatif their party was entrusted with authority appropriations would be curtailed.Likely to Exceed Billion.Notwithstanding these promisespresent indications are that the appropriations at this session will totalapproximately 11,040,000,000. Congress at the Inst session appropriatedout of the public treasury $1,019,000,000, or $1,000,000 less than theamount appropriated by the republicans during the last session of the preceding congress.Democratic loaders confess that theyare unable to see at this time Just howthey can prevent appropriations at thopresent session exceeding the total oflast year. They point to their work inslashing the estimates right and leftand to the resistance of the demandsof their colleagues who sought liberalappropriations. Nevertheless, the total Is going up by leaps and bounds,and a record-excelling grand total Ise«1.Both houses of congress face a critical situation as to appropriation billsand important pending legislation.Only twenty-three working days of thesession remain, and ten of the greatappropriations involving expendituresof nearly a billion dollars, have notyet passed the house.PLEDGE, AND RECORD LIKELY WILL BE BET—AT LEAST $1,-I The difficulty of the situation ao faras the democrats are concerned 1b thatIthey are forced by circumstances topermit the passage of certain billscalling for the expenditure ot millions.For example, the Sherwood pensionbill passed last year adds materially toI the total. Then there is the river andharbor bill, which carries six millions'more than it did last year. The omnibus public building bill wilt soon bebrought into the house and It appropriates $30,000,000. There is no wayto head off this bill. A combinationof republican and democratic members has been formed to push throughthis legislation that would run roughshod over the leaders If they attempted to hold the measure up.Four years ago. owing to extraordinary expenditures required to continue work on the Panama canal, theappropriation for the session ran up to$1,044,000,000, the largest appropriation made in a single year in the history of the government."Watchdogs of Treasury" Fall.In 1899 the republican congress thatappropriated $l,f33,349,000 was characterized as a "Billion Dollar ConI gross." Speaker Heed replied to thecritcUm with the statement that "Thishad ivmo to be a billion dollar country." It was not until 1909 that theappropriations at a siiiKie session exceeded $1,000,000, and there hasn'tIicon a "watchdog of the treasury" onthe ,Ub since then, who has been ableti. ticrii tho expenditures below thatill :in.LEU UTESIBE BESL LIQuestion of Arresting Afchbold, Holger and TeagleMay Cause Trouble.Washington, Feb. 3.—A contest between Attorney General Wlckershamana United States Judge Meek of Dallas, Texas, may soon develop over thequestion of arresting John D.

The fourteen democrats of thecommittee constitutei ts majority andthey will meet in executive sessiondaily until they have revised fourteenschedules of the present law and freelist and administrative provisions aswell.Democratic Leader Underwood, onwhom as committee chairman thetariff making burden fall the heaviest,believes the committee will be able tofinish its work by the middle ofMarch. Upon the committee's progress will depend the date of the extra session of congress. In the firstweok of that session the house democrats in caucus will determine whether .he revision shall be scheduled byschedule or by a single sweepingmeasure.Resort to Income Tax.Tho committee is confronted withthe problem of raising from $325,000,000 to $350,000,000 from customsduties coupled with a pledge of lowering the tariff bars on necessities. Ofthis total figure, the plan is to provide between $$5,000,000 and $100,000.000 by an income tax, now lackingbut one state for ratification of theproposed constitutional a nendment.The income tax. in turn, vould embrace the corporation tax, .vhicli bidsfair to yieid $30,000,000 revenue during this year.A fairly well determined programis already in dictation. In the main,according to the democrats, :he chemical, iron and steel, wool, tton andfree list bills will be like the previousones, but there will be numerouschanges dictated by new ligbL thrownon individual articles.

Congress will cnact a lawto levy a tax probably becomingeffective during tlie extraordinarysession .to called by Presidentft i»lnMarch.

Feb. 3.—The provision authorizing an income tax as nowi?nnen.?nP£rtknown.ofthe federalconstitu­tion will be as the "SixteenthAmendment" and reads as follows:Article XVI.—The congress shallhave power to lay and collect taxes onincomes, from whatever source de-w'",ou'apportionment amongthe states, and without regard to anycensus or enumeration."The change in the fundamental la'Vor the land marks a new epoch in theAmerican tax system. For the first,time congress is given specific authority by a provision of the federal constitution to levy an income tax. Allprevious efforts for a tax of this kindhave been without the explicit authority of a constitutional provision. Thochange also marks a broad development of the economic and fiscal s.vstorn of the a basis for taxation, similar to the systems now in force inGreat Britain, Austria, Switzerland,Spain and various other countries.New Source of Revenue.Probably the most important aspectof an income tax. as now authorizedby the constitution, is that it adds anew source of revenue for the government. At present the two greatsources of government revenue arocustoms duties levied by tariff acts ongoods imported from foreign countries and internal revenue taxes ontobacco, spirits, olemargarlne and certain other articles. Each of thesesources at present produces a littleless than half of the total revenuesof the government. In 1911 the totalgovernment revenues were $700,100,906 and of this customs duties yielded$11.3,846,269, while internal revenue'taxes yielded $331,759,375. The remainder came from sales of publiclands, the corporation tax and variousmiscellaneous sources. Under an income tax, however, a new and farreaching source of revenue ls provided for the government, and this willin turn reduce the amounts requiredrfom the other sources of revenue,'customs and internal revenue, in order to meet the expenses of government. This last phase is likely to havean important bearing on tariff legislation as hereafter enacted.Before the amendment formally becomes a part of the constitution to.day's action of the legislature must betransmitted to the secretary of stateat Washington and proclamation ofthe ratification made.First Step In 1909.The first official step toward amending the constitution so as to authorisespecifically an income tax was takenby the senate on July 7. 1909. Byunanimous vote, that body adopted aresolution, submitting this amendment to the legislatures of the respective states. Only a few days later, onJuly 12, the house passed the resolution by a vote of 317 to 14.WIIjTJ T.KK THAT TO REMOVE AVALANCHE OF .EARTHIt ls estimated that in the slide atThe movement took form during the(Continued on Page 5.)WHICH SI'BMl :GFS TRACKS AND CARS GOETHALS PRE.DICTS MORF EVEX AFTER HE CANAL IS COMPLETED.Washington, Fob. 3.—A report tothe war department describe four newslideR at the Culebra cut. which appearto bo the most serious that have yetoccurred.Cucttracha about 400.000 cubic yardsof earth and rock fell into the canaland will have to be removed.

This is regarded as a strategical movement,possibly with the idea of drawingthe Turks into the offensive.The belief is held among militaryexperts here that no Berious operations are to be expected at Tchataltafor the present. The condition ofthe southern portion of the zone between the lines of the belligerents issuch as to render the movement ofof men impossible. It is little better than a morass. Only on the higher ground in the northern regioncan the armies come in contact andit seems improbable that either sidewill indulge in an attack in force.According to the best informationhere. Adrianople will be able to resist for a long time. Much is expected by competent observers of thenew blood which now is at the headof both military and civil administrations, burning to avenge the earlier defeats, and the enterprise andthe daring of men like Enver Bey,now for the first time given a chanceit is believed may surprise the alliesTWO WRECKSON RAILROADBoth Occurred On The L.N.

YSUBSCRIPTION RATESOne Year (In Advance) $1.00Six Months 60Three Months r 25Entered at Post Ofllce, Illllsboro, Ohio, as Second Class Matter.ADVERTISING RATES Will Bo Made Known on Application.The Sixteenth Amendment.The Sixteenth Amendment to the constitution of the UnitedStates has been ratified by the legislatures of thirty eight states,two more than the required three-fourths. It gives Congress thepower "to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever sourcederived, without apportionment among the several states, and without regard to any census or enumeration."Congress having been given this power what is its duty Webelieve that it should at once proceed to pass an income tax law,Some argue that no such duty devolves upon Congress that theamendment simply gives congress the power to act but that it doesnot follow that it should act at once as present conditions do notdemand such action and the provision is solely for the purpose ofgiving congress the power to pass a law when the necessity shallarise.As viewed in the light of history, is this argument good Wethink not. The Sixteenth Amendment is the only amendment tothe constitution in forty three years. In 1893 Congress passed anincome tax law which the Supreme Court held unconstitutional.For this reason those favoring an income tax law proposed amending the constitution. Finally in 1909 both houses of Congress by athree-fourths vote passed the proposed amendment and now threefourths of the states by their legislatures have ratified it.Since a few years after the close of the Civil War, there has beenpractically as much need for an income tax at one time as another.The members of Congress believed that the people wanted this lawor- they never would have passed the amendment, as most of themwere voting to impose a tax upon their own incomes. The membersof the state legislatures that ratified it also thought that the peoplewanted it or they would not have voted for it, because it is not thetype of measure that is passed by a legislature against the wishesof the people.The people believe that an income tax is fair and just and Congress should pass one at once. We can see no reason why oneshould not be passed. It is only right that the people who are receiving the largest benefits from government should pay for keeping it up that those who can best afford to pay for maintaining thegovernment should do so. A person's income is the best gauge ofhis ability to pay. An income tax it is hoped and believed will takesome of the burden of the support and maintenance of the government off of the shoulders of the poor and put it on the shoulders ofthe rich, where we believe it belongs.But it's opponents says that it will make a nation of liars. Ifa man will lie about his income to prevent paying a tax on it, he isalready lying about how much property he has to prevent paying atax on it. It is not making a liar out of him, because he was alreadyone.It's opponents also say that it will be unjust, as incomes derivedfrom certain sources are much more definitely determined thanfrom others that the man on a salary will almost certainly payRAINSBORO.Feb. 17, 101.1.Edward Fettro, of Clarksburg, W.Va., arrived the last of the week for avisit with his cousin, Mrs. G.

Eachside offered tempting inducements inan effort to gain another ally, but theBulgarian government finally decidedGermany and her friends had madethe higher bid.Bulgaria is rated as one of the mostpowerful of the Christian Balkanstates. Her army, while considerablysmaller than that of her neighbor/Rumania, is well drilled and equipped.Her military strength on a peace footing is only about 56,000, but in time ofwar she is able to put into the fieldsomething like 300,000 men.Robbed of»Victory.Since the second Balkan war inwhich Bulgaria fought Greece, Serbiaand Montenegro, after the victory ofall four nations against Turkey, Bulgaria has been isolated to a certainextent from the other Balkan states.The second war, .which resulted froma dlBpute as to the division of territory won from Turkey, was not participated in by Rumania, which .alsokept out of the first Balkan conflict.Rumanian troops invaded Bulgaria,however, and forced the latter to maketerritorial concessions".When peace was finally restoredBulgaria was compelled to relinquisha large part of the territory she hadgained in the first war. The ill feeling thus engendered made it doubtfulwhether Bulgaria would consent toenter the present war on the side ofSerbia and Montenegro. She steadfastly refused to abandon neutralityunless assured of territorial concessions which would enable her to realize her national aspirations. Chief ofthese was to regain those sections ofMacedonia populated chiefly by Bulgars which now belong to Serbia andGreece. She also sought a section ofTurkish territory.German Diplomacy Scores.The first important victory of German diplomacy was. scored whenTurkey was induced to cede Bulgaria(Continued on Page 5.)AEROPLANEIMAKERSELLS HIS BUSINESSNew York, Oct. 13.

It is considered doubtful thatthe government will consent.GREECE REFUSE^ AID.Paris, Oct 13. After the adjournment of Greek chamber, says a correspondent to the Matin, Former Premier Venizelos called a meeting of supporters, who constitute a majority ofthe chamber, and informed them thatin view of the present circumstancesit would be advisable to adopt a tolerant attitude towards the new cabinet.This would be done, he said, to avoida crisis, the consequences of whichmight be grave, and to avoid giving apretext for the dissolution of parliament.The Athens correspondent of theMatin says he has learned from a diplomatic source that the Serbian government, having raised at Athens thequestion of Greece being called on togive her support under the terms ofthe treaty of alliance, the Greek gov*ernment replied that the present aggressive action of Bulgaria had not apurely Balkan character and thereforedid not come within the provisions ofthe Greco-Serbian treaty.FRENCH REPULSE FOE.Paris, Oct. 13.—The Germans lastevening attacked the French positions near Souchez, according to theannouncement made this afternoon bythe French war office, and wereeverywhere repulsed.There has been artillery fighting ofparticular intensity between theSomme and the Oise, near Andechy,and to the east of Rheims.

ObserveColumbus Day WithGood Program"This goapel of hate, envy andmalice, this crusade against Catholicism will fall: firfct, becausewe know the Catholics second,because we know the orusaderethird, because Intelligence Is at apremium in this country andfourth, because Ignorance Is Impo-'tent. The priests have been ma-'llgned, the nun* traduced and thechurch vilified. Yet Catholics!have sustained a wonderful composure through it all and have retalned their self respect. It willsubside. God Is In His Heavenand all's well with the world."This was said by N. E. Kendall ofAlbia, former congressman from thesixth district of Iowa, in an addresawhich he made Tuesday evening atthe K. C. hall as the closing numberof the program which was heldthroughout the day by the Daughtersof Isabella and the Knights of Columbus in commemoration of Columbusda7 The words were spoken by onewho, as he says himself, "is not aCatholic, not a member of the Knightsof Oolumbus nor eligible to be one."Mr. Kendall said at the beginning ofhis talk that he had Intended to discuss the merits and worth of Christopher Oolumbus for he considered that,not since the great tragedy at Calvary, had any event transpired whichhad meant so much to the world asthe discovery of America by thehumble sailor of Genoa. But, thespeaker related, that shortly after Itwas announced in the public pressthat he would speak at this meeting,a publicaion, whose name he wouldnot pronounce, vas sent to him, containing a marked editorial about a certain man named John C. McGuire being defeated for office and how otherswould go the same route if they didnot steer clear of Romanish affiliations.Mr. Kendall denounced In bitter termsthe editorial, the paper and Its motivesand explained in detail that he was notrunning for any office at this time nordid he intend to in the future. Theaudience, Protestant and Catholic alikeapplauded him warmly for these remarks.Quotes Dr. Gladden."Such action is insidious in its suggestlveness. It disturbs my temper,shocks me by its audacity and y*itamuses me when I encounter its spiritof Intolerance. I can say all thSsethings, I feel, without any impropriety,for I am not a Catholic nor even a communicant of any church." The speakerthen asked to set over against .themarked editorial which he had received, another written for the official Congregational paper by its editor, Dr.Gladden, 4n which that eminent manadvises his people not to dlrctilate rumors prejudicial to Catholics that willnot stand the test of Investigation. Hesays that the Catholic people put toshame their Protestant brothers intheir zeal for their faith and £he sacrifices they make for it. Mr. Kendallsums up the intolerant spirit as thedifforence between love and hate, civilization and savagery, religion andsuperstition, charity and enlighten*ment, proscription and ignorance.(Continued onChicago, Oijt. 13.—First steps forpeace in the garment workers' strikewere taken today when representatives of the employers agreed to meetwith the aldermanic investigating committee to consider a plan of arbitration.The meeting will be held tomorrow.In the event a plan is agreed on, unionleaders indicated that they will sendthe strikers back to work.Chictgo, Oct. 15.

TJIE INCOME TAX
SDGCch dellvorod by William J. Bryan in tho
houso of representatives January 30, 1894. Mr.
Bryan said:
Mr. Chairman: What is this bill which has
brought forth tho vehement attack to which wo
havo just listoncd?. It is a bill reported by tho
committee on ways and means, as the comple
ment of tho tariif bill. It, together with tho
tariff measure already considered, provides tho
necessary revenue for tho support of the gov
ernment. Tho point of attack is tho income
tax, individual and corporation (which is ex
poctod to raise about $30,000,000) and to that
I will devote tho few minutes which aro allowed
for closing tho debat3.
Tho gen oman from New York insists that
sufficient i "cnuo will bo raised from tariff
schedules, together with tho present internal
revenue taxes, and that it is therefore unneces
sary to seek new objects for taxation. In this
opinion ho Is not supported by the other mem
bers of the committee, and wo have been "on
Btralned to follow our own judgment rather
than his. Tho Intornal revenue bill which is
now ponding as an amendment to tho tariff bill
Imposes a tax of two per cent upon the net in
comes of corporations, and in the nnso of cor
porations no exemption Is allowed.
I need not give all tho reasons which led tho
committee to recommend this tax, but will sug
gest two of the most important. The stock
holder in a corporation limits his liability.
When tho statute creating tho corporation is
fully complied with tho individual stockholder
Is secure, except to the extent fixed by tho
statute, whereas tho entire property of tho in
dividual is ordinarily liable for his debts. An
other reason la that corporations enjoy certain
privilege and franchises. Some are given the
right of eminent domain, while others, such
ns street car companies, are given the right to
udo 'thq streets of tho city a franchise which
Increases In value' with each passing year. Cor
porations occupy the time and attention of our
federal courts and enjoy the protection of tho
federal government, and as they do not ordi
narily pay taxes the committee felt justified
In proposing a light tax upon them.
Some gentlemen have accused the committeo
of showing hostility to corporations. But, Mr.
Chairman, wo are not hostile to corporations;
we simply believe that these creatures of the
law, these fictitious persons, have no higher
or dearer rights than the persons of flesh and
blood whom God created and placed upon His
footstool. The bill also imposes a tax of two
per cent upon individual incomes in excess of
$4,000. We have proposed the maximum of
exemption and the minimum of rate. The prin
ciple Is not new in this country. For nearly
ten years, during and after the war, an income
tax was levied, varying from 2 to 10 per cent,
while the exemption ranged from $000 to $2,000.
In England the rate for 1892 was a little more
than two per cent, the amount exempt, $750,
with an additional deduction of $000 on Incomes
' of less than $2,000. The tax has been In force
there in various forms for more than fifty yenrs.
In Prussia the Income tax has been In opera
tion for about twenty years; incomes under
900 marks are exempt, and the tax ranges from
less than ono per cent to about four por cent
according to the size of the income. '
Austria ha tried tho income tax for thirty
years, the exemption being about $113, and the
rate ranging from eight per cent up to 20 per
. cent.
A large sum is collected from an Income tax
In Italy; only incomes under $77.20 are ex
empt, and tho rate runs up as high 'as 13 per
cent on some Incomes.
In the Netherlands the income tax has been
in operation since 1823. At present, Incomes
under $2G0 are exempt, and the rate ranees
from 2 per cent to 3 1-B per cent, the lnttor
rate belns paid upon incomes In excess of $3 280
In Zurich, Switzerland, the Income tax has
been In operation for more than half a centurv
Incomes under $100 are exempt, and tho rate
ranges from riout 1 per rent to almost 8 per
cent, affording to tho pfre nf tho Income '
Tt will be tluw soonthnt the Income tax Is no
new dovino. and It w'll also be noticed that the
committee has proposed a tax lighter in rate
and moro liberal in exemption than that im
posed in any of tho countries named.
If I were consulting my own preference I
would rather havo a graduated tax, and I be
lievo that such a tax could bo defended not
only upon principle, but upon grounds of public
policy as well; but I gladly accept this bill as
offering a more equitable plan for making up
tho deficit i our revenues than any other w 'ch
has been proposed. Tho details of the bill will
be discussed tomorrow under tho five-minute .
rule, and any necessary changes can be made.
The committeo presents the bill after careful
consideration, but will cheerfully accept any
changes which the wisdom of the house may
suggest. The bill not only exempts from taxa-,
tion, but from annoyance as well, every person
whose income Is below $3,500. This is an im
portant feature of tho bill. In order to guard
against fraud tho bill provides that every per
son having an income of more than $3,500 shall
make a return under oath, but no tax is collect
ed unless the net income exceeds $4,000. Tho
bill also provides severe penalties to restrain
tho tax collector from disclosing any informa
tion gained from tho returns made by citizens.
And now, Mr. Chairman, let us consider tho
objections which have been made. The gen
tleman from New York (Mr. Bartlett) who ad
dressed the house this forenoon, spent some
time in trying to convince us that, while the
supreme court had without dissent affirmed the
constitutionality of an income tax yet it might
at some future time reverse the decision, and
that, therefore, this bill ought to be rejected.
This question has been settled beyond contro
versy. The principle has come before the court
on several occasions, and the decisions have al
ways sustained tho constitutionality of the in
come tax. (Hylton vs. United States, 3 Dall.,
271; Deasle Bank vs. Fenno, 3 Dall., 171;
Densie vs. Tew, 2,3 Wall., 331; Pacific Insurance
Company vs. Soule, 7 Wall., 433.)
In Springer vs. United States (102 United
States, 580) tho question was directlv raised
upon the law in force from 1863 to 1873, and
the court held that the income tax as then col
lected was not a direct tax within the meaning
of the constitution, and therefore need not be
apportioned among the states according to their
population.
But gentlemen have denounced tho Income
tax as class legislation, because It will affect
moro people In one section of the country than
in another. Because the wealth of the country
is, to a large extent, centered in certain cities
and states does not make a bill sectional which
imposes a tax in proportion to wealth. If New
York and Massachusetts pay more tax under
this law than other states, it will be because
they havo more taxable incomes within tlieir
borders. And why should not those sections
pay most which enjoy most?
The census shows that the population of
Massachusetts increased Jess than half a million
between 1880 and 1890, while the assessed
value of her property Increased more than half
a billion during the same period. The popula
tion of New York increased about 900,000 be
tween 1880 and 1890. while the assessed value
of tho property increased more than $1,100,
000.000. On the other hand, while the popu
lation of Iowa and Kansas combined increased
more than 700,000, their assessed valuation in
creased only a llttr more than $300,000,000.
This bill is not in the line of class legislation,
nor can It bo regarded aa legislation against a
section, for .the rate of taxation fs the same
on every income over $4,000, whether Its pos
sessor lives upon the Atlantic coast, in the Mis
sissippi valley or on the Pacific slope. I only
hope that we may in the future have more
farmers in the agricultural districts whose in
comes are largo enough to tax.
But the gentleman from New York (Mr.
Coqkran) has denounced as unjust the principle
underlying this tax. It is hardly necessary to
rend authorities to the house. There Is no
more just tax upon ,the statute bookq than the
income tax, nor can any tax be proposed which
is more equitable; and the principle Is sus
tained by tho most distinguished writers on
political economy. ,Actam Smith aays:
Tho subjects of every atate ought to contribute
to the support of the government, as nearly as
possiblo In proportion to their- respective abili-
ties; that is, In proportion to tho revenue which
they respectively enjoy under tho protection of
tho state. In tho observation or neglect of thl3
maxim consists what is called tho equality or In
equality of taxation.
Tho income tax is the only ono which really
fulfills this requirement. But it is said that
wo single out some person with a largo income
and make him pay more than his share. And
let mo call attention here to a fatal mistake
made by the distinguished gentleman from New
York (Mr. Cockran). You who listened to hia
spoech would havo thought that the income tax
was the only federal tax proposed; you would
have supposed that it was the object of this
bill to collect the entire revenue from an in
come tax. The gentleman forgets that the pend
ing tariff bill will collect upon Imports moro
than $120,000,000 nearly ten times as much
as we propose to collect from tho individual
Income tax. Everybody knows that a tax upon
consumption is an unequal tax, and that the
poor man by means of it pays far out of pro
portion to tho income which he enjoys.
I read the other day in the New York World
and I gladly join in ascribing praise to that
great daily for its courageous fight upon this
subject in behalf of tho common people a de
scription of the home of the richest woman
in the United States. She owns property esti
mated at $60,000,000, and enjoys an incomo
which can scarcely be less than $3,000,000, yet
she lives at a cheap boarding house, and only
spends a' few hundred dollars a year. That
woman, under your Indirect system of taxation,
does not pay as much toward the support of the
federal government as a laboring man whose
income of $500 is spent pon his family.
Why, sir, the gentleman from New York (Mr.
Cockran) said that the poor are opposed to this
tax because they do not want to be deprived of
participation in it, and that taxation instead
of being a sign of servitude Is a badge of free
dom. If taxation is a badge of freedom, let
me assure my friend that the poor people of
this country are covered all over with the in
signia of freemen.
Notwithstanding the exemption proposed by
this bill, the pepple whose . incomes are less
than $4,000 -will still contributd far more than
their just share to the support of the govern
ment. The gentleman says that he opposes this
tax in the interest of the poor! Oh, sirs, is
it not enough to betray the cause of the poor
must it be done with a kiss?
Would it not be fairer for the gentleman to
fling his burnished lance full in the face of
the toiler, and not plead for the great fortunes
of this country under cover of the poor man's
name? The gentleman also tells us that tho
rich will welcome this tax as a means of secur
ing greater power. Let me call your attention
to the resolution passed by '.he New York cham
ber of commerce. I wonder how many poor
men have membership in that body! Here are
the resolutions passed at a special meeting called
for the purpose. The newspaper account says:
Resolutions were adopted declaring "tho pro
posal to impose an income tax is unwise, unpolitio
and unjust for tho following reasons:
"First Experience during our lato war demon
strated that an Income tax was inquisitorial and
odious to our people, and only tolerated as a war
measure, and was abrogated by universal consent
as soon as the condition of tho country permitted.
"Second Experience has also shown that it is
expensive to put in operation; that it can not bo
fairly collected, and is an unjust distribution of
the burdens of taxation and promotes evasions
of the law.
"Third Tho proposal to exempt incomes under
$4,000 is purely class legislation, which is social
istic and vicious in its tendency, and contrary to
tho traditions and principles of republican gov
ernment." Still another resolution was adopted declaring
"that in addition to an internal revenue tax tho
necessary expenses of tho government should bo
collected through tho custom house, and that tho
senators and .representatives In congress from
the state of New York bo requested to strenuously
opposo all attempts to re-impose an Income tax
upon tho people of this country."
They say that the income tax was "only tol
erated as a War measure, and was abrogated
by universal consent as soon as the condition
of the country permitted." Abrogated by uni
versal consent! What refreshing ignorance
from such an intelligent source! If their knowl
edge, of other facts recited in those resolutions
is as accurate1 as that statement, how' much
weight their resolutions ought to have! Why,
sir, there never has been a day since the war
when a majority of the jeople of the United
States opposed an income tax. It was only
repealed by one vote in tho senate, and when
under consideration was opposed by such dis
tinguished republicans as Senator Sherman of
Ohio, Senator Morton of Indiana, and Senator
Howe of Wisconsin. It was also opposed in

THE TARIFF IN TUB SENATE
Tho joint resolution proposing an income tax
amendment to tho constitution was approved
by Senator Aldrich, of tho finance committee,
and was ordered to bo printed and lie on tho
table. Tho proposed amendment is as follows:
Article 1G. Tho congress shall havo power
to lay and collect taxes on incomes from what
ever source derived, without apportionment
among tho several states and without regard
to any enumeration.
Mr. Aldrich said ho thought this amendment
might bo passed by tho senate without debate,
but Senator Borah replied that he could not
give his assent until tho income tax amendment
to tho tariff bill should bo disposed of.
Sonator Aldrich. mado no further effort to
obtain action.
With tho tariff schedules disposed of, the
sonato entered upon the consideration of tho
lncomo tax.
Sonator Tillman of North Carolina undertook
to secure a duty of ten cents a pound on tea.
Tho Associated Press report follows:
Sonator Dixon proposed a bounty of 10 cents
a hundred on tea, instead of a protective duty
at tho same rate, which ho said meant 50 per
cent Increase on 90,000,000 pounds of imported
tea a year to foster an Industry which produces
now only 12,000 pounds. General debate fol
lowed, in which senators on each, side of tho
chamber exchanged threats at the other's con
sistency on the subject of probation on the tariff
for revenue only.
"Anybody who undertakes a hunt for con
- s latency here will havo a hard job," said Mr.
.Tillman.
'IAf I "ntorstlnd your proposition you want
saidMr Di - CGntS fr protectIvo Purposes,"
t 7S' i,Ph ubllcan side of the chamber,
I do." said Mr. Tillman "T?. !, i,i t I
' . h iiii- - rn n r
revenue It will
tho duty for the 90,000,000
proauce."
"You shoot with a double-barrelled Run " re
torted Mr Dixon while tho senate was' con
vulsed with laughter.
The Tillman amendment for a duty of 10
cents a pound on tea was then brought to a
vote, and defeated by 18 to 55. Tho affirmative"
votes were as follows: Bailey, Bradley, Bulke!
ley, Burnham, Carter, Dick, Dupont Elklna
Frye Gallinger, Heyburn, Nixon? Peri Bib? Root'
Scott, Smith (Michigan), Tillman and Wetm
all republicans except Bailey and Tillman. Mr
Tillman s colleague voted against tho amend
ment. Concerning tho proceedings relative to tho
income tax the Associated Press report says:
As soon as tho consideration of the schedules
SSdfh0ftenmpl!ted Mr Aldrich mally called
up the Bailey income tax amendment as th
SS3dIMS PTV,Isi0n undor thQ senate igreSmeit
and Mr. Lodge promptly offered a substitute
providing for discriminatory duties to be de
clared by the president when any count?? int
SedXres. WrSZ ift,
amd SSoT r?-
ported by the finance committee ovlB10n re"
Tho Lodge amendment was offered to irivo
the corporation tax provision the posit?on of
"third degree" amendment, which will prevent
any further effort to modify it.
Mr. Flint who, as a member of the finance
committee, is to havo chargo of tho corporation
tax provision, then explained tho provisions of
tho amendment. Ho 'said the finance committee
had not been united on tho question as to
whether It would bo necessary to have revenue
in addition to thoso produced by the pending
bill.
Tho committeo had considered not only a
corporation, but also an Income tax law as sup
plementary to tho tariff and had decided it
would be unwise to pass such an income tax
bill as either of thoso introduced by Senators
Bailey and Cummins. They had, he said, aban
doned the idea of an inheritance tax, because
such a tax was so largely imposed by states, and
they did not wish by making a double tax to
have it becomo burdensome
"When the president suggested the corpora
tion tax," said Mr. Flint, "tho committeo agreed
to it and is here prepared to support it."
Tho inquisitorial features of the bill, he ex
plained, had been reduced to a minimum by the
provision that tho investigation contemplated
could only be made of such books and papers as
were necessaTy.
"Tho issue respecting an income tax had sud
denly changed," declared Senator Cummins in
the senate today. "Until within a few days the
issue was whether any income tax should be
authorized by congress. It now seems to be
what kind of an income tax should be adopted.
The amendment offered by the senator from
Texas and myself, which now has been merged
into a single amendment, provide for a general
income tax to be paid by all persons, co-partnerships
and corporations with net annual earn
ings in excess of $5,000, so adjusted that the
tax would not bo levied upon any person unless
he earned such" an income, even though a part
of it is derived from a corporation.
"Tho amendmont recommended by the presi
dent and offered by the finance committee pro
vides for a small income tax duty on corpora
tions, measured by their net earnings, the diffi
culty between tho two being fundamental and in
volving tho most vital principle in the authority
of any government to tax its citizens and their
property."
Mr. Cummins said that while he believed it
to be tho duty of a senator to give recommend
ations of tho president careful consideration,
he did not consider such consideration as a com
mand, and" he would not want any senator to
accept it unless it is in harmony with his own
judgment. He felt that he could not agree with
the president's conclusions.
"I believe," said Mr. Cummins, "that the
special income tax which has been postponed
by the finance committee not only contravenes
the most sacred principles of our governmental
compact, not only overrides the deepest con
victions that civilized man holds with respect
to taxation, but that it collides with the deci
sion of the supreme court, so often mentioned
in this debate, at the same point and with the
same force as does the general income tax pro
vision which we propose. I believe that it is
not only in conflict with the Pollock case, but
I believe that it has constitutional weakness in
itself, and its validity is much, more doubtful
than the validity of the amendment that we have
offered." . (
"Mr. Cummins suggested that the very extent
of the protective system would make necessary
some other means of raising revenue than that
being followed. The people, he said, would
not consent to tho exorbitant duties that -would
be. required for revenue. Objections that are
urged against the income tax when weighed
with objections that can be brought against
other forms of taxation open to congress will
be found to be. as trivial and ephemeral as
can that term be applied to the tax proposed by
the committeo.
"The stroke of a pen will make the tax au
thorized by our amendment a tax upon ,the
right to receive and enjoy a certain income,
and it will be as well described as the tax which
the committeo insists upon when it is said that
it Is open to the net Incomes of the corporations
with respect to their business."
During Mr. Cummins' comment on the, re
ceipts and expenditure of the government, JVTr.
Aldrich ' declared that with additional revenue
to be provided by the corporation tax, he would
bo greatly surprised if there is any deficit npx,t
year. His estimates of expenditures for the
present year, when the tariff bill was reported
to tho senate, he said, were about $9,000,000
too high, and he had, he said, congratulated
himself that he had estimated within $2,000 000
of the annual receipts.
Tho deficit for the present year, he added
would be about $6,000,000 and not so groat
as formerly estimated. Again he declared that
if the tariff bill becomes a law in its presrnt
form it would next year produce an incom. t
$350,000,000.
Perhaps the most interesting feature of tl.ig
particular day's proceedings relates to Senior
Aldrich's frank confession. The following ig
taken from the Associated Press report:
Senators Bailey and Clay appeared especially
anxious to know whether Senator Aldrich would
revise the tariff schedule downward if the in
come tax amendment should be adopted, in
order to lower tho revenue from customs to
an extent equal to that which would be raised
by tho income tax. It was in response to a
direct question from Mr. Clay that Mr. Aldrich
responded. Stating his position with reference
to the corporation tax, he said bluntly:
"I shall vote for the corporation tax as a'
means of defeating the income tax. He added:
"I shall be perfectly frank in that respect. I
Bhall vote for it for another reason. The in
come of the government this year will show a
deficit of $G0, 000,000. Next year there will
be a deficit of $45,000,000. I am willing that
the deficit shall be taken care of by a corpora
tion, but at the end of two yearB it should
either be reduced to a nominal amount or re
pealed." Mr. Aldrich said he did not favor as a per
manent form of taxation "a tax which is suro
in the end to destroy the protective system."
At once Mr. Bailey declared that Mr. Aldrich
had announced that his attitude in favoring a
corporation tax was a mere subterfuge.
"Under the statement made by the senator
from Rhode Island," said Mr. Bailey, "thoso
who have said they favor an income tax and
now join him in this subterfuge to defeat it may
see clearly what they are doing. We aTe now
told that this corporation tax is to be entirely
repealed or at least emasculated within the next
two years and see that, after all, it is simply
a contest between an income tax as a part of
our fiscal system, or a corporation tax as a
subterfuge to be continued two years.
"My support of the corporation tax," replied
Mr. Aldrich promptly, "is not a subterfuge in
any sense of the word. The corporation tax is
a tax on corporations, which is clearly within
the right of congress to impose, and those sen
ators who are honestly in favor of an income
tax that is constitutional and can be operated
will support tho Income tax proposition of tho
administration as against the proposition of tho
senator from Texas, which is certainly, in the
minds of more thoughtful people, unconstitu
tional." "The least thoughtful people," corrected Mr.
Bailey.
"My direct authority," continued Mr. Bailey,
"for saying this was a subterfuge is the state
ment of the senator from Rhode Island that
he will vote for a' corporation tax for the pur
pose of defeating an income tax. If that does
not define a subterfuge we will need a new
dictionary."
Mr. Aldrich said he favored an Income tax
only for the times of emergency and "declared
Senator Bailey wished to use the tax as a means
for destroying the protective system.
"This proposition for a corporation tax -was
made by the president of the United States be
fore the house committee on ways and means
prior to the timo we considered it here," said
Mr. Aldrich.
"I am here as a- republican to support a re
publican administration as far as I can con
sistently with my duty. I Bhall vote for this
proposition for the purposes I have named, and
the fact that it is a republican proposition and
supported by the president of the United States
is not the least controlling."
Mr. Bailey said he had a curiosity to know
whether, "when they had set their heads at
work to defeat the Income tax amendment, tho
president made the suggestion or the senator
from Rhode Island suggested it to the presi
dent." "I suppose the senator scarcely expects an
answer to that question," responded Mr. Aid
rich, who added, his recent conversation with
the president was a private one.
"While you are talking about all these
things," pleaded Mr. Tillman in behalf of his
tea proposition, "my poor littlo tea baby has
been laid aside and is crying for pap."
Mr. Clay said he believed the senator from

Thooil that it contains is covered up In llttlosacks of a substance called casein. Thcsobeing lighter than water rise to tho top,ami uro called cream.

Wetrace it everywhere; but the Beeret hour ofits birth ba files research. We are forced toadmit its existence, without being able toassign a cause. The Romans undoubtedlyenjoyed its questionable fun. They cer?tainly carried its memory in all their con?quests. Its observance was long cherishedamong numer?os nations. Abandoned tothe yalgar in our self-elected age of extremerefinement, Momus seems to revenge him?self by selecting the most elevated and dig?nified objects for bis practical jokes. Norman, cor nation, nor things visible, northings invisible can elude bis satire. Natureherself seems convulsed with his sly sport.Her groans over a fallen race turn into in?voluntary, hysterical laughter at the biddingof this giant Harlequin, on whose kingdomtbe Ban never sets.The most pathetic scenes provoke thewildest mirth. We see men of bonor andrepaie taking advantage of National schemesto secare private emolument; dividends theonly consideration, the divisor of no conse?quence. April Fool 1 Divisor of scheme,plus dividends, laughing at his dupes, and,thanking Heaven he is not like other men,proving bis integrity by tbe faith of hisfr ?en dB.

This valua?ble periodical enjoyed, for years before thewar, an enviable reputation amoBg the sci?ntifle journals or the day, and when itspublication was unfortunately Interrupted,!t had nearly completed its sixteenth vol?ume. Its original papers on race, climate,natural productions, diseases endemic to;be South, and other subjects or local inter?est connected with medical science, werenvaluable aids to the Southern practitionern his professional duties, while its depart?ments of medical news, records or experi?ments and discoveries and reviews or cur?rent publications, kept the reader constantlyau courant ol whatever was new and val?uable in the professional progress or theworld.

It bas Justbeen probated In Eaglan?, and by it only sixhundred thousand dollars are accounted for,which he leaves to the Empress without re?serve. That sum, though seeming large ls amere trifle to what many American politicianshave put away, and when considered lo con?nection with his unbounded opportunities forpersonal enrichment and bis chances for for?eign Investment, extending over a double de?cade, there can be but one conclusion, that inbis financial arrangements with the govern?ment, which was his trust, he waa strictlyhonorable and conscientious. He was shrewdenough to see that among all the inharmoni?ous political elements Inside and outside ofFrance, his exile might be at any time possi?ble, and bad he been equally unscrupulous, hecould have provided for himself elsewhere asbecame an Emperor. His trust In bis wife lsevidenced by leaving their sou's portion ather discretion.As They See Va at "Thc Hab."[From the Boston Globe.]One ol the most interesting and, at the sametime, one o? the most important statistical re?ports published In the South since the close of Ithe war, Is that lust Issued by the Chamber ofCommerce ot the City of Charleston, 8. C.Some months ago a special committee of theChamber was appointai to collect statisticalinformation relating to the trade and com?merce of that port. It was made up from thesoundest end most reliable merchants o? thecity, with the design o? arriving at a true esti?mate, whether favorable or unfavorable, o?the commercial condition and prospects oftheir community. The report, now submitted,shows the progress of business In produce andmanufactures from the close of 1865 until thebeginning of 1873, a period of seven years, andfamishes undeniable proof of the mercantileetrength and general prosperity of the city.We have referred only to the most Impor?tant items In the report, and though there in awide difference In the progress made In thevarious Unes ol production and manufactu re,all go to confirm the conclusions, drawn fromtheir consideration by the committee, thatwhile Charleston has steadily increased, yearby year, in wealth and enterprise, she ls notcompelled to rely for lier commercial pros?perity upon any one branch of business ortrade. The city is not dependent upon cot?ton, or rice, or lumber, or naval stores, or Job- jbing. It is the union and combination of allthese different branches which give her abroader and deeper foundation than is enenjoyed by any other Southern city, andwhich will one day place her In the Iront rankof the great commercial communities of HieUnited States.?fflciul Uafflc ffnmbers.Of the Oharleston^JPf?t stock Company for tiebenefit of the state o rp nan AsylnmCLASS No. 431-MONDAY MORNING, March 31.18-13-52-1-7-38-00-17-73-33-35-10CLASS NO. 482-MONDAY EVENING, March 81.30-44-70-52-58-39-19-37-30-05-9-31aprl-l A.

JTLI.TOU?"T like to April fool our manager, perhaps,but we don't April fool ourse'ves, because that would be rather cruel.I have outgrown the frolicsomenesof April 1, of course; still I always lookcarefully after my coat tails on thatday. And I greatly enjoy the motleyof those who are careless about theirparraental caudals during the Feast ofAll Fools. The sight makes me feelquite a boy again, for we youngstersused to do that sort of thing in Philadelphia thirty years ago. 0 yes, I didIt, too. I believe that some of the livelier children of Philadelphia do it yet,and have vitality and energy enoughleft to laugh at the result, as a comioparagrapher would say.The most foolhardy of all the trickswhich I can recall in connection withthis carnival of jeering and nonsenseIs one that I have never seen playedEince I was old enough to require twodigits to express my age. A bag andtwo boys were the ingredients of thetrick, and it never failed to 6core agreat success on a quiet side street.One boy got into the bag and the otherStood by it waiting for the victim. Therest of the boys who were "in on theground floor" were hiding in hallwaysand doors and behind trucks acrossthe street. An innocent citizen cameW sauntering along. The boy who hadhold of the neck of the bag stoppedhim with a "Say, mister, please givetoe a lift, will yer?" The innocent citizen usually acquiesced and took holdof the bag to land it on the youngster'sshoulder. Just as he got it fairly inhis hands the boy in the bag suddenlykicked and screamed. Innocent victim, thinking it a bagful of wildcatsor hypnas. let go quickly and ran offwith palpitating heart and hair on end.while all the boys across the streetpursued him with a villainous chorusof "April fool 1 April fool! Wash.your face and go to sclioU" orsomething to the same effect. ItTalways seemed to me that the jokewas really on the boy in the bag;he was sometimes dropped hastilyand heavily and was hurtand occasionally the April-fooled citizen gavehim a thrashing besides for being toofunny. But it was an effective trick.and often an old codger lingered in theshadow on the opposite pavement towitness and enjoy the sport.

But ibey caa't fool me,though I'm too oU a bird lor fiat.than that of the man whoso blood wasfrozen in his heart by the unexpectedscream emitted by the occupant of thebag. Laugh? It would make a tombstone roll over in a fit of hysterics.Jonx Drew.fOMETIlIES IT GIVES PLEASURE TO OTHERS.It doesn't seem right that the firsflay of a month so full of pretty thingsj is April is should be inseparably conw nectcd in our minds with empty arddilapidated pocketbooks with stringin d-small-boy attachments, di&amp;repntable hats with bricks underneaththem, long streamers hanging froml nnsuspecting coattails, door bellsrung by invisible hands, and all theother dear old pleasantries that weknow by heart. And we should prob.ibly have had a society for the prerention of Anril fool iokes Ions aso ifIt were not for the pleasure that callaren gel out of them.When a certain boy of my acquaint-fcnee on April Grst. before breakfast,Informs me that somebody is waitingft;' see me in the library, not for theworld would I refuse to go downstairsand pretend extreme surprise at finding nobody there.

I bitAUlUiD OEnd- Hotter SS6? itLISSrularly ievery year, ana Mr. rfat Gooxnvm orMr. Francis Wilson would be glad ifhe could raise such a shout of laughteras easily and unfailingly.Apropos of this train of thoughtthere is a little picture of mine in Puck,published some years since, which willperhaps bear transplanting here, andwhich I subjoin.Fbedeiuck Buitn Oppeb."de bazoo" is suggested.If yer want a good joke on some otyer frcn's, give dem de razoo, see?Dat's de way dey do in Xew York oaApril Fool day.Yer work it dis way:Suppose a man owes yer ten dollarsand won't pay yen Go see him andask him for it.

Steve Erodie.TO LESSEN THE DEVTL'S FOOLS.I am abked for a sentiment concerning April Fool's day and pause in thewhirl and rush of a righteous warfareto say that in my opinion time is fartoo valuable and important a factorfor a moment to be lost in foolish jesting or senseless joking. The world,especially in these days, is in far toocritical and dangerous a position, socially and religiously, to allow of aman with average sense to saj' nothing of those who have consecratedbrains to indulge in any other thanprofitable and upright intercourse.It is a personal relief to me to feelthat in our ranks seventeen hundredofficers and sixteen thousand unpaidlocal workers will be pushing withmight and main of soul an enterprisewhich upholds sincerity and the necessity of lessening the devil's fools.Ballington Booth.A CHA3IPI0X FOR THE DAT.Before stating what jokes seem tome timely, and enjc&amp;abJe ior thisS&amp;-WIPE DE FLOOB WID niil."April Fool's day, I cannot resist thtemptation to say that I think thespirit of the holiday itself hat alwaysbeen singularly misunderstocd. Theday is really to be deemed a pause intime's serious flight, when folly couldwith propriety travesty wisdom, andset the world smiling. As it is, thefirst of April has come to be deemed anuisance, wheu its observance is notdon away with entirely. April Fool'sday is sadly in need of soue one tochampion it and xestoi e it to its rightful place in the calendar. It is notsimply the day on which the boys andgirls may make fools of their elderswith impunity. I suspect that therewas a time when it was regardedrightly, far away as that time seemsto us now. Then the old people putaside their serious looks and grewyounger instead of older.If it takes a wise man to be a fool,surely April first is the feast dayof the saircs. when thev can act onShakcspsare's admonition: "Mingle alittle folly with your wisdom."As for those jokes which seem to migood and appropriate to the dav itshould always be understood that theelement of surprise is the essentialthing. Novelty is wit. Jokes must notbo cruel pranks, otherwise the daywould ba given up to a general hazingof everybody. The most successful ofApril Fool jokes would be to surpriseone's friends by a change of character.What a rare joke it would be for theconfirmed miser to bestow a dowryupon that niece of his who needs onlya little money to marry the lad of herchoice. If all the cranks would putrside their hobbies for a day, what funit would be for the rest of us.This kind of joke can be carried outad finitum and would never fail to bosuccessful. Let the tippler remainsober to-day just as a joke. The skinflint employer can have a lark withhis clerk by granting that increase ofsalary that has been talked about solong. Let the clergyman I say itreverently preach a sermon only anhour long to-day instead of one offour hours' duration. I am convincedthat the idea would meet with success.People too old for jokes on AprilFool's day? Xouscnc. Even the grayheads can have their joke. The reprobate roue can go to church this morning and explain that it is all a joke onhis part. Many a man is ashamed to doa good thing because it is so unusualwith him that it would give him unpleasant prominence. But he can doit to-day and escape with the admission that it is his April fool joke. Iam glad the day comes on Sunday thisyear. B.

Weekly.srtf3 vXliIN KICH ATTIEEEaster Week and Its Glories ofGown and Hat and "Fixings."The Duchess of Washington Square andHer Neighbors The Apotheosis eCthe Tailor-Made" SpringBoaneta and Jackets.COPYRIGHT. 18W.1If I am asked to show a visitingfriend the smartest houses in NewYork I straightway hire a democraticcab and proceed to "do" Fifth avenuenorth from Madison square. The giltand glitter and splendor of the panorama strike her as I show her thebrownstonc packing boxes of the deadand gone Vanderbilts and recite gliblyas a verger in an English church howthe old Commodore paid four hundredthousand dolldrs for a ramshackle greenhouse and the land upon which it stood.I talk to her of the Astor family feud aswe pass tho LTotel Waldorf, whosoblank wall is the biggest and costliest"spite fence" in all Christendom. Ipoint out the Coleman Drayton house,not large but exquisitely beautiful. Ispeak of the Goelet tapestries and ofthe wondrous art treasures of "Willie"Vanderbilt. At the corner of Fiftyseventh street, I point to the late Mrs.W.C. Whitney's home.beautiful and simple, and describe its broad hall and exquisite ballroom; and the huge andugly pile that Cornelius Vanderbilt hasjust completed. I tell of the wonderful wood carvings in C. P. Huntington's equally big and ugly house opposite, and how a sculptor friend ofmine, Mr. Hill, worked for monthsupon these poems in wood relief. ThenI pause at tho green entrance to ourwonderful park, wave my hand negligently, as if I owned all these splendors, at the roofs beyond and tell oftho Tiffany house and the Villardhouses on Madison avenue, and"These are the real swellest of theswells," my visitors will then say,with a frank sigh of satisfaction ifCHE WALKSshe's from tha west, with a mentalreservation of superiority to merewealth and with precise epithet if fromBoston.This is my opportunity. It neverfails me. and I never fail it."Oh, dear, no'." I say. "You askedfor the smartest houses, and here theyare. But the most exclusive society, asociety which prides itself upon extension rather than intension of wealththis phrase always pleases the Bostonians is found mainly at the otherend of the avenue, near Washingtonsquare. We will not drive there. Thereis nothing to see. The houses are allplain and square and old fashioned.But perhaps"Oh, will you, really?"And so we went to descend fromgeneralities to particulars my latestvisitor and myself; she. from Marlborough street, in the city of the sacredcodfish, quite at home among thestately old houses in the north sido ofWashington square, and quite in harmony with the white and gold furnishings of the room we entered, and thosubdued but tasteful costumes of theiroccupants, robed for Easter Tuesdayrejoicings.The duchess of Washington square;my duchess for there are many ofthem, on the square and lower Tifthavenue and the streets adjacent wasreared and is versed in the school oflace. Indeed, were I to begin generalizing again. I should say that a veryaristocratic gathering of New Yorkladies would be chiefly noticeable bythe lace of the elder ones and the "tailor mades" of the younger. My hostess' white hair was coiled high uponher head and fell in wavy ripplesdown her temples, and her gown wasof black, with a touch of heliotrope byway of vivacity, and from every vantage point of collar and elbow and hemof -waist fell such wonderful yellowlace as thoe who aren't of "the oldfamilies, my dear," may sigh for, butnever gain. And the younger ladieswho received, with her wore housegowns after their several fashions, andthese, with the shifting colors of thecollars raiment, made up a picture ofdelightful and sincere grace.There was one cxqulce creaturewho stood close to one of the whitepainted Corinthian pillars whichmarked off the drawing-room from themusic-room beyond, as if she knewthat the contrast heightened the effectof her dark beauty. She was tall andJunoesque. Her eyes were large andfull and humid and appealing, and mischievous, and pathetic, and a hundredother things all at once, and her hat,which she did not remove, was a widebrimmed felt, with its huge blackplume against the white pillar, and her.cown walda3nij)Xl?cclfit1.a4 JIhere was out one touch or color in thewhole picture, that of huge bunch ofviolets.There was a costume of dull colors,harmoniously set, worn by another tallbrunette, a mulberry-colored cloth with,a plain skirt and jacket back, opening1iover a blouse front of cream colored6atin, and trimmed with a profusion ofknots and bowre and kickshaws ofwatered-black silk ribbon. Indeed, of'this old-fashioned material there waseverywhere profusion, due no doubt toa decent regard for British example.The same lugubrious trimming was'used with good effect upon a close-fittingtailor gown of iron gray withjacket back and blouse front of vieux.rose satin.The jacket or half jacket is almostuniversal this spring. It is pretty, chicand convenient. It gives to the figure,seen from behind, a business-like trimness of effect that is wonderfully softened when the blouse front comes intoview. It is tho compromise of thewomanly desire for form and fabric atonce.I would not like to say of whatheterodoxies of corseting the "tailormade" has been the cause. I'm inclined to think that between the tail,or's ideal of twenty-two inches forwoman's waist and the artist's ideal oftwenty-eight, the former comes much,nearer realization.It is a pleasure always to look atnew gowns; and there is a doublepleasure in having them this Easterweek when spring is here and summeris at nana, and we realize max soonthere will be no more wearing of heavywraps. Nothing 60 quickly spoils theairy jauntines3 of a pair of balloonsleeves as the pressure of a heavy wrap.The j-oung men of New York have become quite proficient in the art, afterhelping a lady d&amp;n her cloak, ofsmoothing down the lapels of the dressbeneath and stowing away the dresssleeves to best advantage within thesleeves of the coat. But the tenderestcare will not prevent damage andand besides this kind pf care seems aHT BEAUTT.trifle intimate for casuaTacqualhtance.A decent regard for British exampleit must be also which has made sopopular a style cf trimming which canhardly be called by any other namethan bib. Just whv a sauare or pointedshield of knife plaits reaching to thebosom and edged with a fold of yellowlace should be considered beautiful Icannot understand. The lace hangsaway from the figure much like thathideosity, a mintel lambrequin, from Jthe wall beneath it, and gives to thofigure a peculiar chopped off appearance, anything but ocbthetically satis- jfactory. Better are the equally British devices of sequin trimming and offull lace corsages, held in place bysatin waist ribbons.British, tor, was a costume of blackmoire antique, with full sleeves anddouble basques, over a vest of sagogreen cloth, with largo steel buttons, asteel buckle for the waistband andtwo others to unite themoireand clothportions of a composite collar. Theplain hanging skirt was of the cloth. Ithink it rather an original idea to usethe silk for tho coat and the roughcloth for the vest. At any rate the ef-feet was good. It was distinctly anout-door gown and such a delightfulcontrast to the house dress of one ofthe receiving matrons, a study in blackand white, the bodice of black satinbrocaded in white, with full sleeves ofwhite satin, the cuffs whereof weretrimmed with tiny ruches of black ribbon. A little vest of tho black satinhad at each side an insertion band ofblack ribbon and the side panels ofwhite satin were barred across in theBame theatric manner.Ellex Osboex.tEPOBTEO TTROXOtGroorn Dese yere papers cebr;tiungs right.Bride How so?Groom "Why, it says we ruz srridat Hymen's altar an' it rraz at olePahson Joanacn'j that's bor.

When lie started hisboat was slodp-rigg-ed, .but .during a stormthe sails were blown out of. theboU ropesand he had to recanvas his '.vessel in thebest manner possible. Under her new "rigthe Spray reached Apia., Samoa." andthereCaptain Slocum took a. rest. The Spraywas sixty-two, days from juan Fernandez-In the Atlantic to Samoa in the Pacific.and it pro.ved:'a -long irnd' tedious journeyfor the lonely -o.ccupo.nt of ihesmall boat.From Samoa the Spray went to Australia and w Zealand, and then back toBoston. by way. of Japan and' China andthe Suez canal.- The, only mishap was rheloss of the sails and the death !of his. "dog,Captain Slocum's only companion.'Captain A&lt;3olph Freitkch is the venturesome man who is going to make the,.VQyage in the 24-footer." He hails fromM'ilwaukee,; and is backed in his venture "byA. K. Brtmer of La Salle street, Chicago.In 1594 he sailed across the Atlantic, in a40-foot schooler, called the Nina,, Hemade the trip alone-, and- It. took the Ninathirty-four akys and- thfee hours to cover'the ■'isinnce from Sandy' Hoofc' to theEnglish coast. Later Captain Freitschmade two trips acros* Lake Michigan in -aFkiff rigged with a sail. He made the lastreturn voyage during the stormy fallweather and was pearly lost. In fact,, hewas bo long making the trip that hiafriends despaired of ever seeing himagain. Alater attempt to sail down theMississippi in a' email boat built by himbclf was abandoned, and since then theTO CIRCUMNAVIGATE THE GLOBE.a TWENTY-FOUR foot boat is now being completed at South San Francisco in which Captain Adolph gA will endeavor to sail around the world. From here he will go to Honolulu, thence to Manila,V **and then back to the United States by way of the Cape of Good Hope. Captain Slocuni made his way 5around the world in the sloop Spray a few years ago, but his venture was easy compared with the oneCaptain Freitsch is about to undertake. »S1 captain has been seeking for fresh veni tures In which to risk his life.On this occasion, according to the agreement. Captain French is to make the[journey from San Francisco to Honoluluin 21 days in a M-foot boat. From H &gt;nolulu he is to make the journey to Manilain 42 days. If all goes well and the voyageto the Philippines is a success the journey will be continued around the Cape ofHope into the Atlantic and thenceto X.ew ork circumnavigating the' globe,a feat never before attempted under suchcondiiThe 2&gt;-foriter is to be caHed the Cokeand. will bo something like CommodoreBaettge'e sloop Ma Belle. In this littlecraft the commodore has weathered two.of the heaviest gales that ever blew onthe coast of California. On earh occasion lie was either on his way to or returning from the Farallones. The firsttime the wind blew over 100 miles an hourand no one ever expected to pp,&gt; t} 1( m :1Belle or her venturesome owner again.But she turned up all right and Batttgesuffered only from the loss of sleep.. The.VI., Belle was out again in th« last stormand finally had to run into Santa Cruz indistress. The adventure-* of the enniniodore and his companions on that occasionare still fresh in the. minds of the public.Froitsch's iVikf- will be different fromtii. Ma Belle in that she will be flat-bottomed and will, carry a eenterboard. Shewill be ri_rcM differently and her sailswill be easy for one man to handle. Atthis time of the year fast trips to Honolulu are not the rule-, so Captain Freitschwill have to hustle to get the Coke to Hawaii in twenty-one days.The Sacramento River steamer Modofiplayed havoc with Broadway wharf yesterday. While trying to make a landing.i the flood tide carried her dowji and shecrashed into the north end of the pier..

Theemail boy was not so much in evidence;is in previous years. Thoughts of Eastereggs on the morrow, coupled with the arduous duties of trying on new suits andboots and hats, drove for once allthoughts of mischief from the mind ofthe budding lords of creation. The officials at the Morgue were the first to fallvictims to the merriment- of the day.When the day was but a half hour old—at 12:30 a. m.— a telephone call, presumably coming from the Receiving Hospital, summoned a Deputy Coroner to takecharge of a body at the Hobson House."Hurry-up wagon" and Deputy wentquickly to the place, only to find thatApril had dawned and that some one unknown wa? taking liberties with dignifiedcity officials.In fact, the Morgue, or. rather, theMorgue's telephone, was the greatest fcuffen-r during the day. The bell rang un--ceasingly from early morning until midi night and all sorts of messages werevoiced- over the line. Heartless wretchesalso employes this method of fooling unsuspecting friends.Tiner-aling-iing."Hello! Well—""Oh. la that you. Mary? This is Jim.Say Mr. Wilson wants to speak with you.Call him up— No. 1947."•'Hfllo. No. 1947! Ts this Mr. Wilson?""No: this is the Morgue."A bang— that's Mary's telephone— aenwe— that is the Morgue.While people were having fun at theexpense of the city the' city was enjoyingIts own pet little April fool joke—repeating the prank over and over a^aln andhailing each new victim with shouts ofapplause and the shrill tooting of horny.At the junction of Market. Kearny. andThird streets at regular intervals a box,neatly packed and stamped, as thoughrc-ady for mailing, would glare the guileless pedestrian straight in the face. Manya man, woman and child, representing allsorts and conditions of society, stoopedto pick up the innocent-appearing box.None got any farther than the attempt.The shouts of the crowd, many of themprevious victims, scared the parcel-pickeroff, and he hastily lost himself in thethrong and waited in his turn for someone to laugh at.It was both a costly and hair-raisingApril fool experience that Walter Mosierhad. Mosier. a young man possessed withan ambition to learn dentistry, is employed by Dr. Perkins, a Sixth-street dentist. Walter's bogs occasionally allowshim to putter around the molars of hiscustomers who are out of funds.One of thes? occasions arose Friday andMosier was delegated to perform thecharity service. The, victim was a boyabout 12 years of age. He was sufferingfrom an ulcerated tooth, and Mosier decided that the nerve must be killed, soforthwith he filled the cavity in thetroublesome tooth with enough arsenicto kill a horse and sent the unfortunateyouth home happy.When Dr. Perkins came in Mosier, withthe dignity of a full-fledged dentist, toldhis employer of his charity work. ThenDr. Perkins thought of April fool."Say, Mosier." said the dentist, with aserious look on his features. "I've justreceived a telephone message to the effect that the arsenic came out of thatboy's tooth and he swallowed it.""My God!" exclaimed, the would-bedentist. lf ls he going to die?""Well, the doctors are working on himnow, but they don't think they can savehis life.""Say. Doc, I'm going to get out of townbefore this kid dies. I don't want to getpinched.""Well." said Dr. Perkins, with a merrylittle twinkle in his eye. "You can suityourself about that, but I'd advise you tostay here. They-can't do any more thancharge you with mupder.""Murder! Ugh! Don't say that. Dr.Perkins," retorted Mosier, tearfully. "Ididn't mean to do It. I'll go and takesome arsenic myself."The crestfallen apprentice spent severalmoments of contrition and then he madeup his mind to get out of town. He got50 cents from Perkins and made haste tothe nearest barber-shop, where he Invested it in a haircut and a Bhave. M osiergave the tonsorial artist orders to cut}-is hair to the scalp and Bhave his sprouting mustache entirely off, hoping therebym disguise himself. The badly frightenedyouth then returned to the office to learnfurther detnils of his mythical victim'scondition. Dr. Simpson told him th« boywas worse and Mosfer. started to leave theoffice. "Wait a minute." called Perkins."Where are you going?'"God knows where I'll go, but I'll nevergo to jail for poisoning- that kid," answered the youth."You go down to the ferry to-morrowand if the boy dies I'll telephone to you,"suggested the doctor.Mosier slipped out to his mother'shome, borrowed 510 and as early as 1o'clock yesterday morning he arrivedat the ferry thoroughly disguised toavoid possible detection. He walked upand down the cheerless and 'desolatewharves till morning, and then not hearing anything from Dr. Perkins bought aticket for Sacramento and stole aboardthe boat like a skulking criminal. Onthe train he acted for all the world likea noted forger crossing the line to Canada.ttosiec confided to a friend before heleft that he would commit BUicide ratherthan go to jail, which knowledge tuningto Dr. Perkins made him decide noi tocfrty the Josh any further. A messagewas sent to the frightened youth, andhe returned to the city. Last night heset about to drown his troubles in theflowing bowl.Garret McEnerney fell a victim to adeeply laid April Fool plot laid for himby his "close up" friend Jim O'Brien..The bulky and brainy man of the lawdropped into O'Briens office, commonlytermed the "Cabinet," yesterday noon toengage the contractor in a little chat."Say. Garret." chipped in O'Brien inan innocent fashion just when the lawyer was i-xplaining to Jim Nealon theway to make money, "when did youstand for that bust over in the Palace?""What bust?" queried Mr. McEnerney."Why. the file they put in the corridorof the Palace Hotel this morning," saidO'Brien as seriously as if he was talkingbusiness with a moneyed man who wanted- to spend a "thou or two" in streetwork."There must be some mistake?" saidMcEnerney. "No sculptor ever chiseledme."O'Brien is "close up," and his wordshad weight with the man who was sobusy dissolving -the injunction againstChief Lees that he did not stop to thinkof April Fool's day."Let's go over, Jim, and take a look atit," said MeEnernty, and .they both started out tho door. O'Brien had no intention of going over with his friend to seekWhat he knew to be a myth, so he contrived to' be excused In a manner thatwould not breed suspicion.The opportunity presented itself whenJudge Lawlor happened along."I'm going to take the Judge on -for aminute," said O'Brien. "You go over andlook at that yourself and I'll wait foryou."Off went Mr. McEnerney and his AprilFool went down on the arc.hives of the"Cabnit" as a decided success. Every.body who dropped into the Cabinet wassent over to the Palace Hotel to see whatMcEnernev had looked for in vain."Pete" Dtinworth. the well-known vocalist, was- the victim of a ghastly AprilFool josh. One of his friends telephonedto Dunworth's house early yesterdaymorning and informed him that an intimate friend had died the night beforeand was to be buried immediately."They, want you to be a pallbearer,Pete," said th-e wily person at the otherend of the line."All right." said the popular tenor, after expressing genuine regret over taeunexpected death of his friend.Promptly at 1 o'clock Dunworth, arrayed in a black cutaway suit and whitegloves, arrived at the .undertaking parlors from which the supposed dead friendwas to have been buried."Is this where Mr. So and So Is to beburied from." asked Dunworth, givingthe undertaker the friend's name and address."Why, he 1b not dead," said the undertaker, "who knew the man very well.

"We havelost the key to the curtain." Mrs. Dunphy. who glitters on the bills as MissHoward, searched high and low for thekey and was in a condition bordering onhVfiterics when the last bars of the orchestra died away and the curtain waslifted without a key.Ocean Water Tub Baths.101 Seventh st., corner Mission.

        <text>    Concerning the origin of the name and custom of All fool's daycontributed more to the extermination ofthe heathen religion and its priests thanall the collateral aids of fire and sword,though they were also freely employed.The continuance of customs— especiallydroll ones, which suit the gross taste ofthe masses— after the original cause ofthem has been removed. Is a very commonoccurence. and by many antiquaries It isfirmly believed that "fooling" people onthe Ist of April is simply a perpetuationof the annual public ridiculing of the oldDruid's and their superstitions.Still another oripin. of a semi-religiouscharacter, 13 thus claimed for April Fools'day In a quaint old book of folk-lorecalled "Father Time's Flyghtes." published in London In 1659. "numerousJewish Origin of the Custom of MakingFools on the First of April. This is saidto have begun from "ye mistake of Noahsending ye dove out before ye water hadabated, on ye first day of ye month whichamong ye Hebrews answers to our firstof April, and to perpetrate ye memory ofthis deliverance it was thought properwhoever forgot so remarkable a circumstance to punish them by sending themupon some fool's errand similar to- theIneffectual message upon which ye birdwas sent by ye patriarch."The French associate with the first ofApril precisely the same Ideas as do Enrllsh speaking nations, but the person Imposed upon, whom we call an April FcJ*.they style an April Fl3h or Polsson d' -vril. In the "Etymology of French proverbs," a most curious and delightfulwork published In 1356. Billlngton I theauthor, gives the following expiationof the origin of April Fool customs "Theword poisson is corrupted throtffn theIgnorance of the people from pasr'on. andlength of time has almost totall- defacedthe original intention, which w^ as follows: That as the Passion of c-n* Saviourtook place about this time o'the year,and as the Jews sent Chris*; backwardand forward to mock and't-&gt;rment him.1. c., from Annns to Caiaph?*». from Caiaphas to Pilate, from Pilate Herod andfrom Herod back to Pilate, this ridiculousor rather Impious custorrAook Its risefrom thence, by which we send aboutfrom one place to anoO«r such personaaa we think proper subjects of our ridicule."But It Is not only thrjU&amp;hout Great Britain, France and our/own country thatfools are made on U« nrst day of April.The custom 1- elabrratfly observedthroughout Sweden, aid In Germany anApril fool la called elnen zam Aprilshlcken." The same custom haa also beenobserved in India fr&gt;m time immemorial.Late in March of hold a great celetratton which they callthe Hull festival, of which the last dayis the greatest aid most general holiday.During the con.nuance of the Hull, oneof its chief dl^rsions is to send peopleon errands ar^ expeditions that are toend In disapr^ ntment anat the expend of the person sent.But the cistom of making April foolshas-been traced back to an antiquity evengreater t!** n that of the Hull festival of.the Hind 9 Tne ancient Persians wer»accustorr«vernal rruinox. which may occur as earlyas ila-^n 22 or as late as April 23. withelaborv*the Utter the chief was the making offool- precisely as we are accustomed tomate them on April Fools* day.jjp a quaint volume of poem.l bearingtH title, "Verses On Several Occasions."i,.id published In London. 1752, April Foola'.ay is thus alluded to:Now April morn b!*r Folly's throas exalts:Now Dobb calls Nell and lauebs because ah*halts."While Nel! meets Tom and Bays his tall laloose,Then laughs In turn and caJTa poor Thoma"Goose."In England, from earliest times, th»ridiculous errands upon which the victimof an April fool Joke sent have beencalled "sleeveless errands." but the originand true significance of this term ar»completely buried in oblivion and no antiquary has yet been able to unearththem. These errands are as numerous asthey are Ingenious. Some of them havaalmost become classics, such, for Instance.as sending a person to a book store forthe second edition of "Cock Robin" orthe "History of Eve's Mother": sendingsome one to a milk dealer for a pint otpigeon's milk and to, a shoemaker for anounce of strap oil. which, if the shoemaker has been Initiated Into the Joke,the Inquirer receives In the shape of asevere blow from a strap acros3 the shoulders. AMY F. STOCKTON.Land in England la 300 times aa valuablenow as it was 200 years a*o.respect the cause he represented.The venerable cattle king gazed at mefor so long that the silence became pain-ful. I heard nothing but the sucking ofpipe stems, and the occasional thud of aheavy, moist globule on the floor. Whenthe President perceived that I had enteredthe room with the determination not topletlves. The point of view has much todo with the relative force of greetings.Thus Paul Kruger can overwhelm avisitor with what we should regard asrudeness, yet on the day following showby his actions that in his heart was onlygood will.When Dr. Leyds learned that I had seenof Oom Paul as a theological humbug,He did not make that Impression on me atall. On the contrary, I believe that hisgreat influence among those who knowhim lies" not merely In that he belongs toa particular branch of the Protestantchurch, but that he is thoroughly honestIn his practices. Of course, rumors arehis first visit to the metropolis.But that, after all. was a mere detail,Lincoln was also an ungainly. If not ugly,man, whom we love dearly for his veryeccentricities of dress and feature. TheTransvaal President, on this occasion,carried a hymn book of portentous size inone hand, and in the other a red ban-toria. and while I -was living at Pieterir.aritzourg. as guest of Colonel Dartnell,the chief of the mounted? police, this Identical dispatch case was one night ucposlte-cTat police headquarters by a mes?engervho could give no Ticcount of himself,and did not even wait for a reward. Ilooked carefully through my treasures;r«ot a thing was missing. And yet theretire people who insist that the Bo*rs arecorrupt!When I reached Pretoria, therefore. I•was without letters, ar.d- I should havebeen without money, had not a goodfriend kindly lent me some. 1 had written ah~ad, however, to Dr. Leyds, detailing my purpose in visiting the Transvaal.end ii;voki:.g his assistance. With thisletter I inclosed one of Introduction.Hut the State secretary was evidentlysuspicious. On the morning after my arrival in Pretoria there came to my hotel a young Hollander whose card wasdecorated with a coronet, and who toldme that he was a secretary of Dr. Leyds,come to express that gentleman's regretsthat he would not be able to receive methat he was not in good health— that hewas too busy— there were lots of othergood reasons, but 1 have forgotten them.So I was inclined to be discouraged— forr.ot only was I there minus my preciousdispatch case, but, apparently, the StateSecretary had determined that I shouldnot see President Kruger, nor anythingelse worth mentioning at the Boer capltal.But Just then along came a pplendidBoer friend, Mr. Jooste, of the Volksraad."We had been fellow passengers to theCape, for he is one of the Transvaalerswho have traveled and studied politics atfir.^t hand. He took me without furtherceremony to the house of President Kru-Cer.When we reached his residence I wasetruck by the e1dences of military protection at hand. He hud a trooper pacingnt his gate, and across the mad. in a vacant lot. was an encampment for the relief of this guard. There was nothing ofthis sort at Bloemfontein. and many Pretoria Boers disapproved of this feature,e&amp;ying it wa* only a dodge of Dr. Leydspound which suggested the lions' ca^e atthe menagerie about the time when foodIs expected. There was a heavy growling,as of surf heating up into caves on theseashore. We approached the door andknocked— we might as well have knockedat a pilot-house in the teeth of a hurricane. The rumbling within rose and fe'l,but obviously our presence was not noted:fo Mr. Jooste pushed open that door, ashe had the previous one. and we enteredInto a cloud of smoke so thick that It reminded me of an engine-room when thesteam has be^n leaking. For a while I sawnothing, though the quality of the vaporassured me that I was in the midst ofa club of smoker? there was no -doubtabout that. Jooste took me by the handand steered me around the corners of theapartment until we stopped by the sideof an armchair. In which there sat. witha pipe between his teeth, a grand oldfarmer— a sort of apostolic cowboy— thatwas Paul Kruger. He sat in state as themaster of this roomful of long-hairedburghers, belching forth guttural phraseswhich sounded blasphemous tj my ears—but to those of the others it was simplyeveryday L»ow Dutch. I was reminded ofthat famous Potsdam Tobacco Club, inwhich the Corporal "King" of Prussiamade life odious to Frederick the Great.When Paul Kruger caught sight of us,and Jooste whispered something in h'scar, he lo'oked at me with bovine stolidity,while the fifty apostles did the same.Then he prunted, and the fifty echoesmade one more grunt. 1 learned afterward that the=e fifty burghers were nothere as an official Council of State; onthe contrary, they were Oom Paul'sfriends, who hud merely dropped in for achat over a pipe and a bowl of coffee.It Is but fair to Mr. Kruger to admitthat he eucceeded in making me feel thoroughly uncomfortable. His fixed, stolid,Ins-CFUtable and ambiguously benevolentgaze rested upon me with suffocatingforce. His fifty apostles backed this gazewith equally impassive eyes, all turnedupon the intruder from far away, whotried meanwhile to make believe that thissort of reception was quite customary InBooks, and a benediction. The b&amp;Mss dlwhat babies are apt to do when thertire of one position, or think it Is mealtime; but baby voices ruffled neither PaulKruger, the parson, nor any one else.The President told m&lt;* a story to Uluj»trats his wickedness as a youngster. Ofcourse we know that his childhood andyouth were spent mainly In cattle wagor.-, and that he did not get an opportunity for being baptized tmtfl he was 15.But In spitp of all these educational handicaps, the Boers who led this gypsy Ufafor so many years managed to hold fastto the Bible and give the youngsters awholesome dose of good old-fashionedCalvinistlc doctrine. But Kruger wasrated as a very bad lad In his day, measured of course by the standard of the"Dopper Church." He told me that he wasnot merely the best wrestler, the bestrider and the beat shot of his time, butwas also noted for playing all sorts ofpranks calculated to shock the good people of his community. I suppose he wasa bit of a Tom Sawyer in his way.The first church for the new town wasabout ready.- I forget the cane perhapsIt was Rustenburg. At any rate, youngKruger. along with the r-r,t of the peopl*of that community, had worked upon theeacred edifice, and the tlm? tame for somesolemn function connected with Its dedication. On that particular day, when allthe people, in solemn garb and mien, had,assembled to do honor to the occasion,there was a psychological moment whenall gazed up to the rocf and saw a youngster standing on his head, clacking hisheels together. That youngster was PaulKruger.What happened after that has not yetbecome accessible to the historian. Iheard that Influences were subsequentlybrought to bear upon him which produceda change of heart, to say nothing of anew skin. His father appealed to him Invarious ways first at one end, then a:the other. Which prevailed I know not-Some years after this young Kruger became subject to melancholia and retiredto the wilderness without letting any one,not even his wife, know of his whsro-abouts. He was several days absent anthen his neighbors went in search. Theywere pulded to him by hearing the chanting of hymns In the distance— and from,my experience of that voice ther musthave v.card him a day's Journey off. PoorKruger had been fasting, and was boemaciated that he had to be held oahorseback as they brought him home.That was in 1557. when 32 year 3 of *_*•From that time on Kruger was a changedman— a devout Christian according: to hislights.By Poultney BigelowAuthor of "White Mao's Africa."

No answer! We knocked a second time, and louder. There was no answer! My friend pushed the door open,and we stood in a hail which traversedthe whole house, and led to a big yardbeyond. We knocked again. No answer!We went out Into the yard and shouted—no answer! A negro girl poked her headout of a Bide building, but withdrew Itsuddenly on seeing us. Evidently Mrs.Kruger disliked bells and parlor-maids.Then I eald to Jooste that I presumedthe family were not at home; but Joostescouted the Idea. Just then I heard.

I was treated quite as well as thecustoms of the place demanded. I was atthe Boer court, and was experiencing etiquette n la Kruger.Yet now I recall that ordeal with something of a shudder. I have met a greatmay kings in my day— black kings, whitekings, and yellow ones. Monarchs of manykinds have I bowed to— millionaires, political bosses, war lords and other mightymortals. But I confess cheerfully thatno king, kaiser or Congressman ever mademe feel so completely the nothingness ofmy worthless self as did old Paul Krugerover his pipe and bowl amidst his fiftycowboy cronies. He commanded my dreadand admiration; he almost made merife that he 'is corrupt, that he has putaway vast sums, that his religion Is merely a cloak for wickedness. That may allbe true: but I, tor one, have no evidenceto support that view, and I find that sachstories emanate usually from a class ofpeople whose trade It Is to rely mainlyupon money for their influence. I do notbelieve Kruger Is corrupt— l do not believethat all American Congressmen are corrupt—l prefer to be an optimist.On Sunday morning I saw the President, quite alone, walking toward a veryshabby church near his home.

Ther»was a long prayer, a long: sermon, a hymnor two. a chapter from the Book «f4period of eight days. April 1 Is theoctave of March 25, and the last dayof a festival octavo was always markedby the greatest abandon and festivity.At the New Year season especially allsorts of wild, mirthful pranks were Indulged In, and of these It is believed thatour April fool usages were a part.Origins of a religious nature have beenboldly claimed for April Fools' day bymany writers. An old English antiquary,writing In 1753. states that the custom ofimposing upon and ridiculing people onthe Ist of April may have an allusion tothe mockery of the Savior of the worldby the Jews. Something like that whichwe call making April fools Is practicedalso abroad in Catholic countries on Innocents' day, on which occasion peoplerun through all the rooms, making a pretended search in and under the beds. Inmemory, I believe, of the search made byHerod for the discovery and the destruction of the child Jesus and of his havingbeen imposed upon and deceived by thewise men, who, contrary to his ordersand expectation, "returned to their owncountry another way."When the early Britons were Induced toforsake' their Druidical priests and Idolsand to embrace Christianity, It was theircustom" for many years after to annuallyhold in their churches at the commencement of April a great festival, resembling the Roman Saturnalia, at whichthey indulged in a thousand ridiculousand indecent ceremonies, gambols anddancing grotesquely to ludicrous anthems.These singular observances referred to theexploded pretensions of the Druids, whomthis festival was designed to hold up toscorn and derision. That there Is no moreeffective weapon than ridicule was againproved In this case, for this feast of fools""Whence proceeds the custom of makingApril fools? Answer: From a memorabletransaction happening between theRomans and the Sabine.3, mentioned byDionysius. Which was thus: The Romans,about the Infancy of their city, wantingwives, and finding they could not obtainthe neighboring women by their peaceableaddresses, resolved to make use of stratagem, and accordingly Romulus institutedcertain games to be performed in the beginning of April (according to the Romancalendar) in honor of Neptune. Upon notice thereof the bordqring Inhabitants,with their whole families, flocked to Rometo see this mighty celebration, whereuponthe Romans seized a number of the Sablnavirgins and ravished them, which imposition, we suppose, may be the foundationof this foolish custom." This most absurdand wholly unjustifiable account of theorigin of making April fools is thus ridiculed by a poet of the time:Ye witty tiparks who makes pretenseTo answer questions with good sense.How cornea.it that your monthly PhoebusIs made a fool by Dionysius?For had the Sablnen, as they -came,D-partpd with their, vlrirln fame.The Romans had been Jtyled dull tools,"And they, poor Rlrls. been April Fools.Therefore. If this be" n't out of season,Pray, think and give a better reason.Some old folk-writers claim that ourApril Fool customs are attributable to thefact that the year formerly began, as tocome purposes and in some respects, onthe 25th of March, which was supposed?o be the day of Our Lord's incarnation.At that time' it was customary for allfestivals to continue for an octave, or(Copyright and nil rights reserved.)"The first of April lome do say.TVoa «et apart for All Fools' Day;But why the people call It «o.Nor I nor they therr.reUes do know."Thus an old English poet sings truly,for It would be a hard matter to find anyone who can give an accurate and correctaccount of how the Ist of April came tobe known as All Fools' day and of the origin of the custom pertaining to It of then_ trying to make foolsW of people generallySf in every conceivabletjrfjf V^ WS&amp;JS"'"^ manner. In oldbooks of folklore al-most innumerabler I jo^w statements are madeBf &amp;a concerning the or-B y igin of both nameit and custom, all dlfferlng as widely asthe poles and bearing not the slightestWlatlon to each other.A learned antiquary, writing in 1599,claims that our April Fools' day Is but acontinuation of the Qulrinalla, or feast offools, bf the ancient Romans.

Thotruo origin of April' Fool Is burled lutho dust of centuries and our greatest antiquaries seem unable to throwany light on tho subject. Nearly allpeople however, celebrate this day orits equivalent and the similarity ofthe practice and tho coincidence ofdutes establishes without n doubt Inthe minds of authorities ihe fact thatIt had an early nnd common originamong mankind.Nearly all tho peoples on the Continent celebrate April Fool with pranksand tricks, and even the Hindoos havoa festival on tho 31st of March, calledHull, which coincides vjlth our AprilFool.Ono of the most popular amusementson April 1, or All Fools day, as it Iscalled, Is tho Rending of persons onfruitless frrands. Unsophisticatedpersons are sent to tho bookstores fora copy of the "History of Eve's Grand,mother," or to the chemist's shop for"pigeon's milk," while small boys arcsometimes sent to the harness shop forstrap oil, when a liberal dose of thistreatment Is usually administered tothe boy.There Is a story told to the effectthat Francis, Duko of I,oiTaIne, midhis wife owed their escape from captivity at NanteH to this popular custom. Arrayed as peasants, they weremakiug their way out. of the territorywhen they were discovered by a woman who knew them. She Immediately hastened to a guard, and told him"that the Duko was escaping. "AprilFool," said the guard laughingly,treating the matter as a joke, andwhile he laughed the prisoners madegood tlieir escapeOccasionally a gigantic hoax Is perpetrated on tho people as a whole, andsuch a one met 'with groat success inLondon in I8RO.

'With tho extra work occasioned by sugar making,nnd the busy season of spring comingon so early, farmers throughout thisportion of tlie.

Many farmersnow say that tho offrr of wages seemsto make no difference, and that farmlaborers cannot bo obtained at anyprice they offer.In this vicinity offers of $22 to ?2S amonth and board, which is a higherllguro than usually paid, brought nohelp and many ngrlculturlstB have sentsouth and brought Inboiers from Kentucky. The reason for this shortage of helpIs not because of hauler work or moreexacting duties that heretofore, buton account of tho great army of former's boys who havo gono to tho cityto learn trades nnd procure employment during tho past year. If the rushof farmer boya to tho city continuestho coming year no it has during thopast season the farms of this vicinitywill bo practically deserted of all laborers but those- imported from otherstates.A GREAT SHOWIs the Fourth Annual Exhibitionof the Camera Club.In addition to tho rare and beautifulcollection of pictures which the AkronCamera club has gathered together nndIs now exhibiting to the public, thoclub has secured ono of tho best setsof Inntem slides that Is In circulationby tho American Lantern Slide Interchange.

Taylor Tells Commercial Club of TrafficPlans.Plans for the establishment of threemore jitney routes in Columbia werepresented by Frank L. Taylor, originator of the jitney service here, tothe members of the Commercial Clubat the weekly luncheon today.The new routes, according to Mr.Taylor's plans will start from theDrug Shop. One route will coverNorth and South Eighth street Thesecond route will be on Broadway,Price avenue, and Paris Road toMoore's Switch and return over thesanie route.' The third route will runeast on Broadway to College avenue,south to Rollins street west to Providence roa'd, north to Conley avenue,cast to Sixth street, north to Broadway and east again to the Drug Shop.These routes may be changed beforethe establishment of the routes, by apetition from the patrons of the route.In establishing these routes a similar plan will be followed as in theestablishment of the Westmount service. Fifty patrons will be asked topromise to pay ten cents a day or $3a month for three months to insurethe success of each route.Mr. Taylor asked for the cooperation of the Commercial Club in the organization of a traffic service for Columbia. He said that he had investigated the conditions In many townsabout the size of Columbia and thatthe conditions here were more favorable for the establishment of a jitneyservice than in any other town."The one Jitney car now being operated is on a solid basis," said Mr.Taylor. "But I do not believe thatthe new routes now being plannedwill be able to take care of the traffic in six months time. It is my planto purchase five small touring carsfor the present but. I think that Itwill be necessary to purchase largebuses, like those being used by thejitney companies In Kansas City. Thenew routes will be started just assoon as fifty signers are obtained foreach route."G. W.

        <text>    10THE COCAINE MONSTERTHROWING HIS TENTACLESAROUND THE NATIONHOW IT GRIPS ITS VICTIMSThe Deadly Drug Whose InfluenceCarries Men to Insanity andDeath Becoming Too PopularValue of cocaine leaves imported at theport of New York in 1894.114,384; importedin 1807, #54.122; indicated value ot importsfor 18SKS, $75,000.In these simple figures are contained theelements of a warning sermon that wouldstartle all America. We seem to be rapidlybecoming a nation of cocaine fiends, it thenumber of those addicted to the u.-e ol thedreadful drug continues to increase at thepresent rate the importation of what "asoriginally regarded its a blessed alleviatorof pain will have to be classed with opiumami its use prohibited by law, except tormedicinal purposes.At present the cocaine Bend can pill-chasethe drug without trouble and the case withwhich it is taken is a fatal recommendation to those who crave a nerve-dcadener.No laborious cooking of pills over a lamp,cleaning of implements or troublesome necessity for secrecy, as with the use of opium.Cocaine can be taken at any time, withscarcely any trouble, anil without a soulbesides the being aware ot his beingin the toils.At first, that is. It will not be long beforeevery intimate friend will observe c change,a gradual ami scarcely perceptible change,come over the appearance and general conduct of the cocaine fiend. II the one whoyields to the toxic influence of the drug bea lawyer, then it will be noticed that Ilialanguage as he pleads a case in court hasbecome particularly diffuse, while his arguments are long drawn out and lacking inlogic. Others will notice this peculiarityand wonder. The victim will be in hli'siulignorance of anything wrong, for anotherqueer phase of the progress ot cocaine pots-Suing is that il lulls the user into a delightful feeling of self-satisfaction, and,whatever his shortcomings, he is contentedami happy—until the influence of the drugdeparts and leaves him only with the deadly craving for more that none can tight oil.The lecturer who becomes a victim to thecocaine habit will, to the surprise ot hisaudience, spend the enure period allottedto a certain subject on a single insignificantpart of it, or seem to tot get the topic entirely and wander into something entirelyforeign. It will strike the listeners thatthe learned lecturer has been drinking or isbeginning lo get feeble-minded, there willbe nothing in lie appearance or manner ofthe speaker to indicate that he himself hasthe slightest knowledge that he lias notbeen treating the subject in the brightestand most careful way. Cocaine is a drugthat deludes its victims. It i- the very devilblmsell in tin form of an innocent-lookingcrystal, and the way the much-to-be-pitiedcocaine user is dragged slowly, but withaw ml certainty, down, toinsanitsand deathis a terrible tribute to the strength ol thedemon that links in ihe drug.This confusion oi ideas and language isthe first symptom of the toxic influence ofthe cocaine beginning lo work. It you havea friend in whom these symptoms are noticed, il might be well to find out il he isaddicted 10 the use of cocaine, tor at thisearly stage the habit may be broken. Laterit is almost hopeless for the victim to tryto sunder his chains.Begun in many cases in a legitimate way,as an anesthetic, the surprisingly pleasanteffect is sought, lor again by the one who hashad a glimpse ai Ihe portals of elysium. This iis tbe beginning of the terrible habit. The ieffect is a sense of exhilaration followed by aquiet, dreamy state that causes the worriedman to forget his troubles and the sufferer ihis pain. nn,.,. this freedom from physicaland mental sickness has been experienced,the cocaine fiend will t 01. or kill to get the Iding. Enforced non-use of it will not curethe victim. Sentence him to a term ot'imprisonment, ami he will go straight fromthe jail door to the nearest drug store tosecure cocaine before he eats or sleeps. iThis, of course, cannot last. From anocccasional use of the drug to insatiablecraving is the rational course of the cocainefiend. From thence to the insane asylum ianil the grave is a swift and easy descent. iFacsimile of Signature and Sketch Drawn. From Life of the Former Secretary of State Whose Able Work IsAttracting; (International AttentionNEW YORK. Dec. 7.—Now that Frank!J. Gould, the younaest of the sons of Jay(«juld, has reached his majority, therebyunder the terms of his father's will becomt ing one of the executors and trustees of theestate, it is expected that he will also soonbe elected to membership in the directoratesof the various Gould properties. His threeolder brothers are on these boards, but eachhas some interest to which he devotes hisspecial attention. Oeorgc .1. Gould is especially active in the management of theMis-ouri Pacific system. Edwin looks afterIn his fall from health to physical andmental disintegration the cocaine fiend undergoes a terrible experience. When not inthe temporary heaven that the drug provides, the victim is in the lowest depths ofan infeino. He is subject to apprehensions, delusions and hallucinations. He suffers from insomnia, anorexia and gastralgiclatins, dyspepsia, chronic palpitations andwiil-paresis. He is a terror both to himselfand others. The life of the man is a livingdeath. He knows it, nnd with this knowledge -taring him in the face, he rushes forthe drug nnd is happy for a brief perftdunder its influence. It is time somethingwere done to keep from this high-strungnation a drug so deadly. Clear-mindedmedical men have recommended its exclusion from the country, believing that its usemedicinally should be foregone rather thanthat such a cursed temptation should beplaced in tbe way of weak humanity."What tbe real action of the drug is, andhow to counteract its influence, aie at present puzzling questions to the medical fraternity. A lending member of the profession to whom these questions were put replied, alter careful consideration, as follows:lis physiological action is practically unknown. As an analgesic, it is uniform inits action, and this is due'to the suspensionof the physiologic functions of the sensorycells which it comes in contact with. Beyond this, it is an excitant of the cerebrospinal axis, later it has a peculiar ac? Tunon the encephalon, manifest in a wide rangeof physical phenomena. Beyond this agreat variety of widely variable symptomsappear. In some cases all the intellectualfaculties are excited to the highest degree.In others a profound lowering of the sensesHid functional activities occur.

In some cases well-markedcerebral anemia appear, and for a tune isalarming, but scon passes away. Few casesof death are recorded from an overdose, aii they are comparatively rare, and the poisonj ous stales which follow usually give way toappropriate remedies. Small doses frejquently given are more readily absorbedthan large doses. Habitues always useweak solutions, the effects being more pleasing with less excitation. The morphineand alcoholic inebriates very soon ecquire acertain tolerance to targe doses taken atonce. The cocaine User takes large quantities but in small doses frequently repeated.:He becomes frightened at the effects ofhuge doses, and when be cannot get theeffects from small (to him safe) doses, heresorts to alcohol, morphine or chloral. Inmany cases memories of the delusions andhallucinations are so vivfd and distressingi that other narcotics are used to preventtheir recurrence. In other cases the recol-I lection is very confused ami vague, andI strong suspicions rill tbe mind that the real(condition is grossly exaggerated by thefriends for some deterring effect. In common with opium and alcoholics there ismoral paralysis, untruthfulness and lowcunning m order to conceal and explain thecondition by other than the real causes.The prognosis is always doubtful when theaddiction has continued any length ol tune.The temporary removal of the drug andrestoration of the case occurs In nearly tillcases, but unless a radical change of life andli ing is made, and the patient gives unusual care to his health and to tbe avoidanceof every source of exhaustion of nerve andbrain, and every condition of peril to hishealth, the danger of relapse is very prominent."The treatment must be pursued on gn:eral principle-. Isolation and removal ofall exciting causes and building up of thebrain and nervous system comprise the general principles. In every case certain special localized means are essential to meetthe various conditions present. The Middenremoval of the drug is' the tirst step. Thecontinuous activity of the skin from hot air,sweating and baths is essential) and thisshould be kept up for a long time."Among foods, meats are to be used sparingly at lirst: as the case improves their usemay be increased, A diet of eggs, milk andgrains with fruit is best. The patient shouldremain in bed or reclining at full lengthmost of the time during active treatment.Muscular exercise by massage for an houia day should be given. If this is net practicable, walking in the open air with an attendant or a few moments' exercise withropes and pulley" will aid in reducing themuscular nervousness.LOS ANGELES HERALD: SUNDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 11, 1898"Exercise and matsage depend for theirvalue largely on the adaptability of the caseto bear it. In a brain-worker less exerciseor massage i„ requiredi than in a muscleworker, or one who if. out in the open airmuch of the time. In an over-fed, plethoricI person, exercise is better borne and followed by greater relief than in spare ones.Most cases should remain in bed the lirst'week after treatment and then begin to sitlup and take mild exercise. Daily bathsshould be continued with regularity andicare. Panistent watchfulness over all actslot the patient should be kept up for sixor eight weeks, then a rigid course of living;and diet should be arranged and ita importance Insisted upon foil a long period to come.All these carat should be under medicalcare and control for a long time before fullrecovery can bo expected.''BEARS NATURALLY PEACEABLEAre Mischievous but Not DangerousUnless Attacked1 can verify the .statement of Mr. Hardyof how bears eat berries, and, indeed, feed inother way-. Stories of bears are currenttalk in the'backwoods, and the old residentshave learned a good deal of their habits inthis way. Often in the then very thinly settled North Michigan woods I have accompanied mv wife on her berry gathering excursions, fearing to let her go alone on account of the numerous bears which sharedthe enormous quantities of the'finest berries which grew in the windfalls. Onec whenthus engaged at one side of a gigantic pinewhich lay over breast high, we heard a sortof scuffling on the other side of it. amid thedense growth of blackberries. Thinkingsome other person was on the same businessas we were, no notice was taken, but all otus, bear as well, as we found afterward,went along the fallen pine tree until we camenear to the top of it, when, looking up. bothof us saw at the same instant the head of ahuge bear, as it showed itself by its headbeing far above the level of ours.The bear saw us at the same instant andstopped eating, with an armful of bushesgathered between its forelegs. We did notmove, but stood quite still, nnd very soonthe bear went oil with its meal, picking oilthe fruit with its mouth. We, of course,gently backed out of the bushes and left thebear still feeding without any offensivemovements.After that, and with some other experiencethat bears are by no means quarrelsome iinot disturbed 01 tl riven to resistanoe, orevendisposed to tight when attacked, but ratherinclined to get away, even the women audchildren of the locality were not alarmed,further than to get away in the easiest manner and leave the field to the big. black,shaggy fellows, in fact, this animal seemsto be in no way quarrelsome, if lie is permitted to get his share of what is lyingaround, and is only dangerous when attacked anil brought to bay.Bears often amuse themselves in thewoods by breaking trees. When campingout on exploring expeditions or on surveys.I have heard the bears at night breakingdown the limb* of quite small trees, apparently for amusement, and they are quitefend of tearing the bark from trees, apparently for the ume reason, or otherwise toget at the sweet underbade, which is doubtless what they are after. In fact, they areplayful animals, and when seen withoutthem knowing it they will play and'romp together as a lot of boys will, wrestling witiieach other and chasing each other in arough sort of game, which is very amusingwhen their inoffensive habits have become known. But few people care to gettoo closely acquainted with them.They are exceedingly mischievous and playhavoc with one's camp and blankets, whichthey will tear into strip*—in fact, completelywrecking the outfit. Once, on going to acamp which had been left for some days,we found on returning to it a big bear in amo.-t ludicrous mess. An old butter firkinhad been left outside the camp, of coursehaving some leavings of butter in it. Xearing the camp, we heard a noisy sort of scuttling, and nt once thought of bears. Coiningnear the camp, there was h bear on his hindlegs, dancing around in such a manner as tothrow my Canadian-French foreman in ahelpless condition of imbecility and helplessness.He pranced and howled and rolled on themound. The bear had its head fast in thekt-f, and was pawing for all it was worth loget its head loose. It rolled on the groundalong with Francois, who might have gotinto trouble had the infuriated bear got itshead free. But it was not until the beartan again" a tree and knocked the staves100-i that it could see what was the matter.Then it made off with the hoops around itneck into the woods and was lostFrancois did not quite recover for a longtime, but would at times burst into a roarof laughter when at serious business whenanything recalled this adventure with thebear—Forest and Stream.Color Line Drawn at a Baptismal PoolThere is a division in the Central Baptistchurch at Woodbury, Xf .1., brought aboutby a peculiar phase of the color question.The Key. I. M. B. Thompson, the pastor, ofthe church has threatened to resign.Recently the colored Baptists requestedpermission to use the baptismal pool in theCentra] church for the immersion of theirconverts. Backed by the hearty indorsement of the pa-tor, the committee receivedthe desired permission from the trustees touse the pool, and arrangements were made10 do so. Then objections began to be madeby the white members of the congregation.Many of the women objected to the use ofthe baptismal pool by the colored Baptists.They objected to being immersed in thesame pool in which there had been coloredbaptisms.The discussion, vigorous at lirst, soon grewto be acrimonious, and two sides wereformed in the church, one protestingagainst permitting the use of the pool byconverts of the colored Baptist church, andthe other side as vehemently insisting uponit. The trustees listened to the objections,and at a recent meeting withdrew their permission. This angered the colored Baptistsin the place, who said they had been humiliated. The ReV. Mr. Thompson has takentheir part and told the trustees that theymust again give permission for the use ofthe baptismal pool by colored converts, orhe will resign his position as pastor.—Proma Xew York Dispatch.If you are an invalid youshould drinkFruiton orFruit Coffee.It nourishes you and makesblood and bone.

"What will youhave?" asks the amiable clerk andpoints to a list of sirups, a row of gaylycolored bottles and some large bowls onthe counter containing crushed strawberries, sliced pineapple and otherI tempting fruits. If you stick to thefruit sirups and the fruit is really good,no harm is done. On the contrary-But if you turn to the bottled attractions or listen to the promise of theirmuch advertised qualities, then beware.Here is plain warning from Dr. L. F.Kebler, chief of the division of drugsin the government bureau of chemistry:"Attention is directed to the danger ofsoft drinks containing caSeine, extractof kola nut and extract of coca leaf, theactive principle of the two latter beingcocaine."According to Dr. Kebler, scores ofsoft drinks, dangerously medicated, aresold at soda water fountains as stimulating and refreshing summer drinkswithout the slightest intimation to purchasers that their stimulating and refreshing qualities come from cocaine, adrug that produces one of the worsthabits known to the medical prefession."We have seen," said Dr. Kebler,"how the opium habit may be acquiredby the use of various proprietary or secret preparations usually employed asdomestic remedies, and so the cocainehabit may be developed by the use ofthese much lauded soft drinks."During a recent visit to WashingtonI talked with two heads of departmentsin the bureau of chemistry, both activein government prosecutions of druggedsoda water sirups. "There is no question," said one of these authorities,"that the presence of cocaine in softdrinks tends to create in the consumer,whether child or adult, a predispositiontowards the cocaine habit."It is evident that the manufacturersof these soft drink sirups have only onemotive for putting cocaine into themthat is to make them popular, to makethem taste good, to make them sellbetter. And this popularity, this pleasant taste and better sale come simplyand solely because there is enough cocaine in these soft drinks to give something of the stimulating and exhilarating effect that cocaine always gives."It is not uncommon," says Dr.Kebler, "to find persons addicted to theuse of medicated soft drinks. It is awell known fact that many factory employes, stenographers, typewriters andothers subject to mental or nervousstrain spend a part of their earnings fordrinks of this character. Parents, as arule, withhold tea and coffee from theirchildren; but, having knowledge of thepresence of cocaine, caffeine or otherdeleterious agents in soft drinks, theyunwittingly permit their children to beharmed by their use."Cocaine —what is it? The StandardDictionary tells us: "Cocaine, a white,bitter, crystalline alkaloid contained incoca leaves; used in medicine as alocal anesthetic." And again: "Coca,the dried leaves of a South Americanshrub of the flax family, used in medicine as a tonic; chewed by tne native iIndians as a nervine stimulant." Thereis no connection between the cocashrub and the cocoa palm tree that produces cocoa nuts.An ounce containg 480 grains and agrain of cocaine is a dose. From asingle source of cocaine supply in NewYork city 480,000 doses of this dangerous drug were illegitimately dispensed every month.How is the habit usually acquired?"By accident, like other drug habits.I'm sorry to say that one of these —er—accidents is the presence of cocainein catarrh medicines." Dr. Podstataproceeded to give me details in thecase of one of his patients, a man of 22,who became a cocaine fiend quite innocently by taking a widely advertised"catarrh cure" that contained only asmall percentage of cocaine, but, alas,enough to establish the habit. Theyoung man sniffed his "catarrh cure"up his nose, and after each sniffing experienced a characteristic sense of elation, a peculiar well being. He tookmore and more of the stuff and soon{discovered that his exhilaration camefrom cocaine in the powder. Now, itwas cocaine he wanted, not the catarrhcure; and presently he began to takethe drug pure, sniffing it, after the man-i ncr of adepts and finally learning to usejit in hypodermic injections. Soon he jlearned that the sensations were not at Iall pleasant. Far from it! Quick aftereach period of intoxication came thei dread of reaction that calls for more and ialways more cacaine. The characteristic physical and moral deteriorationwent on rapidly. The victim grew sallow-faced, sunken-eyed, restless, irritable. He lost ambition and perseverance. He became a liar, a wreck, helpless and useless, and within a year hewas placed in an asylum.Notice that all this came to pass because a perfectly well-meaning youngman bought at a reputable drug storein Chicago what was advertised as an jexcellent cure for catarrh. And beforehe knew what he was doing and takinghe had become a "coke fiend" and hislife was irretrievably ruined.At Hull House, that haven of goodworks in Chicago, I found impressivecorroboration of the statement that children easily fall into the cocaine habit.Dr. Hamilton, a woman bacteriologistof Hull House, made an investigationamong boys and young men in theneighborhood and found that numbersof them were regular users of the drug.Dr. Hamilton found that the cocainehabit had spread through one group ofseven boys. The youngest,Willie, wascoming home from school one day whena negro who offered him a sniff of powder, saying it would make him feelgood. Willie sniffed the powder and,as he expressed it, felt like a millionaire. The negro sold him what waslelt of the powder in a little pill boxfor IS or 20 cents, and told the boy hewould be around that corner every evening with more of the stuff. He alsosuggested that Willie inform his boyfriends of the wonderful effects of thispowder. Willie went back to the corner and bought more of the drug. Hewanted to feel like a millionaire. Hetold his two brothers, young men of 17and 18, and they tried the powder.One by one four of their friends wereinitiated until the group of seven wasformed. All seven became absolutelydemoralized; they quit going to school,stopped work, stayed away from homeall night, going on regular cocaine debauches and spending as much as $7in a single day for the drug. Whentheir money gave out they would pawntheir clothes, they would steal, theywould do anything to get more moneyto buy more cocaine.Through the earnest efforts of theHull House people these seven boyswere cured of the habit. Dr. Hamiltonthinks a cure is possible for the young,though rarely possible for adults. Evenso, the effects of their long indulgencein cocaine did them permanent injury.Their power of resistence was enfeebledand three of them died of tuberculosis.It is a question, too, whether the othershave been quite sound mentally.I talked with a husband and wife,both "coke fiends," whom I found ina filthy hovel on "Cocaine alley," thefoulest part of Chicago, and they both jassured me that they thought nothingof spending 84 or 85 a day for "dope." jThey might lack food, clothing, warmth,decency, everything; but without cocaine they could not and would notlive. This husband, strange to say,was a man of intelligence and nice instincts. He wore glasses and had afine brow. He was a carpenter by tradeable to earn good wages until he gotthis habit. His wife, a shattered, shriveled, frantic creature (she was on theverge of the cocaine "leaps" informedme with a certain pride that she hadonce been a famous dancer in the BlackCrook company.In an adjoining hovel was a colored—a tall, lithe, wild-eyed victim, whosaid a dollar's worth of cocaine was onlyenough for a few sniffs, it would scarcelylast an hour.Pure cocaine, which is manufacturedfreely in various cities, is worth about84 an ounce. That is what crookedcocaine merchants pay for it. Then heretails the drug by the little pink pillbox full, or the little blue bottle full,and by thus subdividing it gets for eachounce 820 or 825. That is, when hesells the stuff pure to those who want itfor "hypos" and know the difference;but to the "sniffers" he sells the drughalf adulterated with acetanilid, a verycheap powder that looks like cocaine,and allows him to double his gain.I Sometimes these vulture retailers willwork off on very desperate, half-crazed"fiends" a quality of "dope" that istwo-thirds adulteration, which gives thedealers a profit of 860 an ounce!No wonder a flashily-dressed negTO,known as the "coke king of Chicago."i boasted that, if the police would leaveI him alone for a single year, he would jretire with a fortune. And no wonderIhe has been able, by the devices ofwell paid lawyers, to get himself speedilyout of the Bridewell every time he has!been sentenced there. Residents on jthe mean street where this nogro lives Iwill tell you of smart automobiles drawing up before his close-barred, dingyshanty, and of well-dressed men or veiled Ij women hurrying through the alley to a1 back door. They knock and the doorI opens slightly. The caller deposits acoin in the hand that appears in thei opening and receives in return a smallbox of cocaine. A chain guard prevents the caller forcing the door openmore than a few inches. It is always jquite a trick, the detectives say, toI "catch these cocaine dealers with thegoods."A handsome Southern girl, daughterof a judge, is a typical case. On herfather's death the family was left inneed, and this girl came to New Yorkand went on the stage Her beautyand slender figure, together with a natural charm, gave her advancement andthings were going excellently when shewas taken ill. The company was traveling at this time, and to relieve her painand allow her to play her part, a doctor jgave her cocain. That was the beginning and the end is not yet. She married a few months later, and her hus-band soon discovered she had the drughabit. For years he has tried to breakher of it, but nothing has availed. Sheis still a young woman with some of jher old charm; but people notice that,she is queer. She is unreliable; in factit seems impossible for her to tell thetruth. She has suffered a startlingphysical change. Her face is pallid andshe stares at you with a frightened, furtive look. She is very thin, and theysay she hardly ever sleeps.

These "cures,"according to Samuel Hopkins Ad. mis InCiilliri'i UVi'Afjr, were "Dr. Ilirncys Catarrh Cure," "Dr. Colo's Catarrh Cure.""Dr. Agnow's Caiairh Powder" and"Crown t 'atari li Powder." Not only didthese "euro." Introduce many pcionsInto depth of cocaine addiction, butthey pointed the way to a method of jtaking cocaine easier than by hypo- 1dermic.For u time It became the practice tofill Willi the "cure" a small bottle1through the cork of which had been In-M-r'etlit wo tubes, one of which wasplaced In the mouth and the other Inthe nostril; u puff from' the mouth didthe rest. Later It became the custom tosprinkle the "cure" on. the back of thehand and either 'to touch It to thetongue or to sniff It onto the mucousmembrane of the nostrils. Tims thedeadliest of all vices became the Minplcslto begin.Among the thousands who contractedcocaine addiction through the innocentputchase of a patent medicine was Mrs,Anna .Meyers, who was prominentsocially In Chicago and In lsim was amember of the board of managers ofthe Chlcngo World's Fair. In a confessiou detailing the career of crime Intowhich cocaine plunged her Mrs. MeyersMays: "I used to get the little boxes ofthe drug and call it 'my baby' and 'myonly friend,' cry over It and laugh anddance like an Insane person."It Is asserted that per cent, ofAmerica's drug addicts learned theirvice In a doctor's olllce. Hundreds ofdisreputable physicians make a practiceof giving morphine promiscuously fortheir patients' iicIick, out of their ollleesIssues a constant procession of youngdrill, addicts "Not more than 10 percent, iif all the drug addicts have anyincurable disease that would Justify further use of the drug." says Dr. Towns.The use of drugs has crept Into colleges,where students take them tn counteract the effects of overwork; tfiey liavocrept Into the army, where soldiers takethem ltd counteract the effects of underwork. "Many great writer to use acurrent critical phrase," su's Dr. T. D.Crothers of Hartford, Conn., "begin theuse of cocaine that they may whip theirInventiveness to action."Walters in restaurants use drugs toquicken their memory. It has beenestimated that 1." per cent, of all themedical men in the United States aredrug addicts, "Onehalf of nil my drugpatients ore physicians," says Dr.Towns, who has uhill now pending atAlbany, Introducedby Senator John .1.Itoylan, barring alldrug addicted physicians from practice.

This anti-opium legn.-latlon which went Into effect on February ivvv. prouioneo tne importationof any opium into the t'nited Stateexcept for medicinal purposes. It causedthe ancient secret of making smokingopium to lie brought to the CulledStates from China and tons of opiumimported "for medicinal purposes" wasI cooked Into smoking opium here.The opium poppy began to be grownm California; licenses were taken outunder the act of 1S90 for the Americanmanufacture of smoking opium, andMiioklng opium actually began to exported. Meanwhile the government Islosing t l.r.ou.iitoi annually In opium lduties, while ten big tlnns are Importin:,'f.rm.ooo pounds of crude opium a e.ir"for medicinal purpo-cs" and selling it iin r.i'O pound lots to any one who can'show anything like a druggist's order.I net eases n duties In both the Payneand the riulervvood tariff are the Ciov -ernment'sonly other anti-drug steps.The l.'nderwood bill, on October 9. 1913.made these Incie.ises ever the Paynetariff: Crude opium Imported for iihiIicui.il purposes, l r,o to 43 a pounddi led opium Imported for medicinal purposes.

He not onlywrote drug prescriptions, but tilled themhimself. He bought 9,3110 ounces ofcocaine between December 9, 19a. andJanuary 30, 1913, although thousands ofdoctors use less than one ounce In alifetime. I tut this was perfectly legal.It was Dr. lllcksielu's opium Indiscretions which sent him to the Federalpcuileiitliil'y.

JamesB. Curry of St. James' Soman Cotholiechurch when asked for his views onthe war on habit forming drugs.Father Curry became interested inthe fight on cocaine nine years ago, andhe has been fighting it ever since. Heis familiar with every phase of thematter"It is a matter that the federal government mast deal with sooner orlater,' he said. "The widespread useof drop*, which is ruining the lives ofthousands of men and women in thiscountry and. most important of all.lives of thousands of boys and girls,makes it incumbent on the officials inWashington to take cognizance of thisserious matter The time for procrastination is past, and we must get quickaction.No individual state can successfullycombat the evil For mstance. if NewYork state passes a drastic law regu- day.lating the sale of drugs it will be a-ample matter foe unscrupulous sellersof the drug to obtain, their supply inNew Jersey or another state.'On some sides I have heard physicians of this city criticised for fillingprescriptions which enable the bearer*to obtain supplier of cocaine Rputbie physicians ore striving to lessenthis evil to the best of their ability"I do think the wholesale drughouses are responsible for the spreadef this evil As an example of howeasy it is to obtain cocaine and otherharmful drugs from wholesale bouses,an acquaintance of mine recently informed me that he could jret as muchof the drag as be wanted without anorder from a physician or anybodyifise I aSBL"* surprised that I re-1raestet him ttPmafce the effort."He made out a list and mailed it toa drug bouse and asked for prices.

InAmerica 4.45 per cent cf the population uses drugs.Mrs Vanderbilt began her fighton the nation-wide use of drugs inthe New York Legislature, whereshe fought for a bill prohibiting thosale of cocaine, heroin and morphine. She has given large sums ofmoney to organizations opposing thedrug habit In her efforts to obtainlegislation against its saleThe entire civilized world hasbeen shouting about the horrors ofthe opium traffic of China. TheChinese were the originators ofopium. It is believed. In China itwas found 200 years ago that 6per cent of the people were drugvictims. By consistent fightingagainst tho use of drugs; by lawslimiting its manufacture and sale,the use of druj;s there has droppedto 4.1 per cent of the population in200 years.In America, however; the use ofthe drug is on the Increase.Laws preventing the transportation of cocaine from one State toanother are sought by Mrs. Vanderbilt, and in working for federallaws her experts have compileddata to show the enormity of thedrug habit.Drugs are used by all classes. Thecriminal class Is addicted to Its use.Cocaine 1b Injected Into the aim.Opium la smoked and taken in other ways. Sometimes the drugs aresnuffed. They are taken to driveaway tho feeling of drowsinesssometimes. Country doctors acquire the drug habit because oftheir long hours of work. Theytake drugs to keep themselvesawake and take other drugs so theycan go to Bleep quickly.Society women are known to takej drugs to drive away weariness inpursuing their social conquests.The terrible effects of takingeocaine have been pointed out timeend again. In 1888 Dr. J. HowellWay wrote to the Medical News hisexperiences with cocaine.He Bald he Injected, one-quarter1 grain of cocaine in his forearm atj 6 p. m. Thirty minutee later hetook a half grain. In ten minuteshe became restless and his hreathlng was affected. In twenty minutes his pupils began to dilate.By 7 20 his condition was nearcollapse. By 7:30 he began to fearhe would die. Cocaine was not aswell known then as it is now. andDr. Way took the drug simply asan experiment.He took restoratives when he began to fear death. His breathinghad dropped to nine respirations aminute. His mind was clear andhe felt no pain. His trouble wasmental as far as he could tellIt was at 1 a. m. when he feltnormal again, and he went to sleep.OPIUM IMPORTEDINTO CHINA.While the Chinese are believed tohave originated? opium, they did notraise enough to supply themselves,and had to import the drug fromIndia and the East Indies. The fighton opium b'-gan in China in 172',but met with little success untilSeptember 20, 1906, when the importation of opium was prohibited.Drugs are needed as medicine.They also are used to a large extentIn patent medicines. The government requires a statement on thepackace giving the quantity of drugcontained in medicines.The Chinese opium smoker livesfor years.

Armstrong atHampton. Va. These visitors fromall parta of the world, are attractedby the unique and effective educational methods which Hampton Institute has been successfully employing for over forty-five years intraining negroes and Indians forunselfish and efficient service in thohome, on the farm, In the shop,end In the kitchen.Hampton Institute is an industrialvillage with some 1,200 or 1,300 stu-dents. 200 teachers and workers, 140buildings, and an instruction farmof some 600 acres Whatever workthe Hampton School need Lo havedone, the students are usually prepared to do.

These operations were no easytasks. The bulk of the work had tobe done in hot and trying weather.The boys labored with a will. Theywere happy to have an opportunityof doing well what professionalbuilders considered a difficult pieceof work.Later, when the school authoritiesdecided to add a story to the Armstrong-SlaterMemorial Tradenormal activities In spite of thedrug they take.

Yet anyAT PIONEER INDUSTRIAL AND AGRICULTURALSchool, the student tradesmen againattacked with enthusiasm the laborious task of raising the heavyroof and putting on the pecond story.Then came the tedious days devotedto finishing the Interior work. Therewas always the joy of doing successfully tasks generally considered beyound the reach of tradesmen Is thetraining.Agnln the call came to do somebuilding which would require skill,patience, and endurance. It was theerection of a two-story brick building to he used as a social center forthe boys Contracts were awardedto the Trade School Departmentsand student tradesmen did tho construction work To-day the buildin? stands completed. It is knownas Clarke Hall. It Is used by theYoung Men's Christian Association.To appreciate the meaning of thesethree examples of construction workdone by the Hampton tradesmen,one must see the completed structures and realize the building problems which the young negro andIndian tradesmen met and successfully solved.While construction work calls forability to read working drawingsand follow detailed specifications,the demands made by repair problems are in many instances evenmore taxing To make a repairquickly, skillfully, and economically, requires unusual ability. Hampton Iristitute Is Indeed an industrialvillage in which there Is constantdemand for men who can do goodrepair and construction work.Hampton alms to fit young menand women to do well and in an uncommon way the common lasks oflife. Students are taught to handletheir tasks like skilled workmen.They have for their work an excellent equipment and they are expected and required to take the bestpossible rare of the school's property. They receive financial creditfor their work and they are requiredto keep a strict account of all thacthey e?.rn and spnd during theyears of their training at Hampton.The work for girls at Hamptonleads to the Important occupationsof home-making and teaching. Whena girl enters Hampton Institute shehas tht opportunity of receivingthorough training In Domestic Science. The girls work daily fortwelve months In the laundry andin the boarding departments underthe supervision of experienced teachers, and carry on their academicstudies In the evening the same asthe boys who are in the work class.The mental and moral training,which the year of combined workand study gives, makes it one of themost valuable years of the course.The worklns: day for the girls Isshorter than for the boys, but a girlmay earn from S15 to J1S a month.This enables her to be entirely selfsupporting during her first year Inschool, and to accumulate a balancetoward defraying the expenses ofthe second ear A girl in the workclass needs very little money besidesher entrance fee and first mouth'sboard. This course is advised forall new girl's regardless of their ability to pay their way in the DaySchoolThroughtout their course atHampton Institute, negro and Indian girts are taught the elementsof arithmetic. English, agriculture,history, as well as scientific housekeeping, physiology, cooking andseeing, and the principles of teaching. Almoet 8,000 young men andwomen. Including 1.200 Indians,have already gone from HamptonInstitute Into the South and West,equipped In body, mind and heartto help their races get land buildbetter homes schools and churches,and Improve social and economicconditions.

The enforcement of thelaw threw thebe new patients ontheir hands and they could not treatthem without giving them somadrugs To break a man or womanin a day of a habit contracted inyears might cause a fatal reactionof the heart, they said, and manyof them went on record in opposition to the Harrison laIn several hospitals the LambertTownc treatment was used but withno great success, according to reports.

As the patient took fromthe bottle containing the narcotic.i the amount was refilled from thebottle containing a cure until thedrug bottle contained practicallynothing but the cure.Pmc tws, however, complainedhat when the reduction methodStarted they were not given anwhere near the amount to whicftthey were accustomed. Many of thepatients took as high as 6n tabletsof heroin a day while other fiendstook 16 to -0 "shots of morphiuWhen the amount was reduced theyabandoned the hospitals in de-per;.-tionand went back to their oldhaunts. Hospital doctors were sen1out at night to go through the tenacrloin and Hop Alley districts to investigate and found practically allof their patients back in their oldenvironment and all showing evidence of being under the Influenceof narcotics--although with theglihness and unreliability of chronicusers of drugs, they denied it.Despite the lack of cures for thehabit the great machinery of thegovernment has been set in motiontoward the enforcement of the antidrug art and between the activity ofa limited number of internal revenue agents and the fear the lawviolators have of the federal laws.FAECES INTHE C01 R I S.In several courts men and wornen found guilty of selling cocainehave been given six months in jail,while under the state laws they received no more than a 950 fine frtheir offense.

God’s Message in Science to Thinking Men
Or, Science bs. The Saloon
Demonstrated Tacts of Science Demand Total Abstinence as the Only Temperance,
and Prohibition as the Only Policy Tor the State
Address delivered before the Southern Baptist
Convention at Hot Springs, Ark., May 16, 1908.
R. TAYLOR, the author of the address
given below, is a noted student of the
scientific aspects of the liquor problem.
He is one of the founders and a direc
tor of the Scientific Temperance Feder
ation of Boston, which is the American
branch of an international organiza
tion having for one of its objects the
establishment of exact truth by scien-
D
tifie demonstration as to what alcohol really is, and
the publication and dissemination of the facts.
Many distinguished scientific men in America and
in Europe are associated in this work.
Dr. Taylor embodies the findings of such men in
his address and weaves them in away peculiar to
himself into a telling argument against present so
cial drinking customs and license policies of govern
ment.
The address made a profound impression upon all
who heard it, and should be sent over the country
by tens of thousands of copies as a campaign docu
ment and be carefully studied by every voting citi
zen as a policy to be pursued, leading up to the per
manent solution of the saloon question. The ad
dress in substance is as follows:
THE ADDRESS.
The real origin of the present prohibition move
ment is to be found twenty-five years back, when
temperance physiology was first introduced into the
public schools. The publicity given that movement
resulted in much information being obtained by the
masses long before the subject began to bear its
natural fruitage through the instruction of the
schools. The principles which gave birth to the
movement should be steadily applied to guide it un
til it reaches its climax.
We know more about the subject today than we
did fifty or twenty-five years ago, or even one year
ago. The researches of chemical and physiological
science have brought to light new facts and princi
ples displacing old-time notions and guesswork. We
have temperance sentiment enough, but it is not up
to-date or scientific temperance sentiment. Every
body believes in temperance according to his notion
of what temperance is. Nobody believes in
intemperance. The question is what is tem
perance and what is intemperance in the light
of modern science? Some people expose their
ignorance on this subject as ridiculously as a young
man betrayed his ignorance of the Bible, who sup
posed that the Epistles of Peter and Paul were
wives of the Apostles, or as a young lady did who
supposed that Sodom and Gomorrah were husband
and wife. Thousands of otherwise very intelli
gent people suppose that alcohol holds some conju
gal relation to a great many good things.
President Hadley of Yale University is spoted as
having recently said that just as soon as the voting
men of this country get into their possession the
principal facts touching the nature of alcohol they
will drive every saloon out of the same. If this be
true,’ it is an indictment of the intelligence of every
advocate of the saloon.
What then, is this alcohol, the knowledge of the
nature of which voting men need so much? This
lecture is designed to answer that question, and
when answered, all other questions like, Does pro
hibition* prohibit ? will dwindle into comparative in
significance.
Alcohol, Not Beer, the Issue.
The issue in temperance today is not as touching
beer and whiskey or beer instead of whiskey, or the
abuse of either. It is the alcohol question. The
discussion of scientific men revolves around the na
ture of alcohol which is the essential property of all
liquors. If alcohol is good, then the beer and whis
key are good, if alcohol is bad—a poison—then beer
and whiskey are alike bad in proportion to the per
centage of alcohol they contain.
The Golden Age for May 28, 1908.
Ethyl Alcohol a “Waste.”
Few people can give an up-to-date or scientific
account of ’what common alcohol is or where it
comes from. Many suppose that it is everywhere
in nature; call it a “good creature of God,” and
say that it is to be found in sugar, apples, peaches,
grapes, barley, rye, beets, etc., whereas, there was
never a molecule of alcoho| found in any of them,
nor anything like it, nor is it to be found in any of
the constructive or building-up forces of nature,
but rather in what we call the decomposing process
es of nature. Yeast ferments, which live in the at
mosphere, otherwise called common yeast, or brew
er’s yeast, are put into barley juice, after the starch
of the barley has been changed into sugar by the
sprouting process. These germs absorb therein the
sugar, extracting from the same the oxygen. This
having been done, the remaining constituents of
the sugar, namely, carbon and hydrogen, are
changed about in their relatioi s and become some
thing entirely different from sugar—poisons—and
are thrown out of the germ bodies as a waste, called
carbonic acid gas and alcohol. In other words, li
quor men have called it “bug juice.” Or, accord
ing to another theory, the yeast germs extract the
oxygen from the sugar without absorbing it into
their bodies, leaving the waste, called alcohol. Both
theories are supported by eminent authorities.
Classification of Poisons.
As to the food value of alcohol the consensus of
scientific opinion today emphatically denies to al
cohol any food value in any proper sense of the
term food. That question appears to be settled.
On the other hand, the same consensus of opinion
places alcohol among the poisons. But what kind
of a poison is it? There are three general classes
of poisons: Narcotics, irritants and narcotic-irri
tants. A narcotic poison specifically attacks the
nerves and nerve centers. An irritant poison at
tacks the inner linings of the body, like the mem
branes of the mouth, throat and stomach, inflaming
and making them sore. A very few poisons com
bine the two characteristics of narcotics and irri
tants at the same time. Alcohol is one of the very
few and is therefore a more serious poison than if
it were only a narcotic or exclusively an irritant.
Its specific type and potency as a narcotic poison
places it in rank with opium, morphine, chloral and
cocaine. Its type and potency as an irritant poison
places it in rank with carbolic acid and arsenic.
The logic of this classification is that we are com
pelled to, treat alcohol socially and legislatively ex
actly the same as we treat every other drug with
which it is properly classed. We have no more
reason in chemical science for using alcohol as a
luxury than we have for using cocaine as a luxury.
The difference between cocaine and alcohol lies
chiefly in the fact that the former is a powerful
local concentrative and will “knock a man out” in
short order; whereas, the latter is a slow diffusive
poison. But it gets there after a while.
The cocaine fiend is filled with hallucinations,
will lie, steal, sell clothes from his wife’s back and
shoes from his chidren’s feet to get more money
with which to buy cocaine in order to gratify his
appetite, but he is seldom vicious. But alcohol,
which is classed with cocaine, will do all for its user
that cocaine does and, in addition, when he goes
home, he will blow his wife’s brains out. This is
chiefly because alcohol has the two-fold characteris
tic of a narcotic and irritant poison which cocaine
has not.
The larger cities in many parts of the country
are passing ordinances forbidding the sale of co
caine by drug stores except upon a physician’s pre
scription under a penalty provision of S2OO, more or
less, for every violation, which is scientifically the
thing to do; but for every argument in favor of the
prohibition of cocaine there are two arguments in
favor of the prohibition of alcoholic liquors.
The following conclusions are incontrovertible:
There is no more reason in science for the bever
age use of alcohol in solutions called beer, wine or
whiskey than there is for the beverage use of so
lutions of opium, morphine or cocaine, and there
is no more justification in the legalization of places
where alcoholic liquors may be Sold than there is
in legalizing opium or cocaine joints. The appetite
for liquor is as abnormal unfortunate and unscien
tific as is the appetite for any other narcotic drug.
It is logically, and constructively, as much of a
crime for any voting citizen to cast a ballot fbr a
policy of government whereby another man might
gratify his appetite for liquor as it would be to
cast a ballot to make legal a joint wherein an opium
fiend may gratify his appetite for opium.
The argument that prohibitory legislation inter
feres with a man’s right to eat and drink what he
pleases is as absurd as it would be to affirm the
same concerning morphine or cocaine. The same
may be said of the argument that, “they will have
it anyway, therefore, we might as well legalize it;
tax it and get some money out of it.” Would any
decent man say that of morphine fiends? Or the
argument that if you abolish the saloon, it will
drive business to some other town. Would any
self-respecting man use such a plea in behalf of any
other narcotic drug with which alcohol is classed?
Should any man, professing intelligence, undertake
to build up his business by advocating a law legaliz
ing the sale of cocaine for luxury purposes, he
would be warned to leave town between two days.
And yet it is equally absurd and criminal to ad
vocate the legalized saloon.
From every angle at which one considers alcohol
he gets a correct view only when it is classed as a
narcotic-irritant, to be treated in no way different
from other like poisons.
Such is the argument drawn from a proper classi
fication of alcohol among the poisons.
Alcohol a Brain Poison.
A no less startling or potential argument against
the beverage use and legalization of liquor is found
in the direct action of alcohol on the brain.
Every poison likes some one part of the body
better than it likes another. For instance, the
poison of lead likes the muscles of the wrist. Mer
cury likes the salivary glands the best. Manganese
likes the liver. Tobacco likes the heart the best.
Arsenic likes the coating of the stomach, strychnine
the spinal cord, and alcohol likes the brain the best.
This places alcohol at the top of the list as the
most serious poison of all those mentioned because
it likes the brain the best, which is the most vital
and sensitive part of the human body, the home of
the mind.
In the light of that statement I have a choice as
to what poison shall attack my body. I would pre
fer to have a “wrist-drop” from lead poisoning
than a brain-drop from alcohol; or a liver complaint
induced by manganese than a brain complaint in
duced by liquor. You may have an arm, both arms,
a limb, both limbs, rob me of my sight, my speech,
my hearing, maim my body as you please, but spare
my brain. You may send me to a hospital for the
surgeon’s knife, but keep me if you please from an
insane asylum. I want to be able to think, to think
right, and know, and reason. The brain is the home
of the mind and alcohol has a selective affinity for
the brain.
But why does alcohol like the brain the best ?
Recent investigations by Prof. Hans Meyer of the
University of Vienna, confirmed by other noted spe
cialists, show that nerve substance contains a larger
proportion of fat than other tissues; that all the
substances called narcotics are able to dissolve fat.
They enter into a loose chemical combination with
tlie fatty constituents of the cells, “ilnd imme
diately inhibit the vital processes of the cell.”
It is also well understood that alcohol has a pe
culiar selective affinity for some cells over others;</text>
